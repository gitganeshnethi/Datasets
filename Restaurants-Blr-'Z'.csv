The wait time was 25 mins which was the only drawback I would say, no reservations accepted post 4 pm so make sure you book your table before 4 pm. Ambiance is lovely and the staff are courteous and fast. While talking about the food loved their signature  samosa soup and the Burmese peeper soup, crispy lotus stem was average where as Thou mash with Paratha was outstanding. Ordered china town noodles and Burmese fried rice for mains and was pretty good at well. Talking about the desserts the chocolate caramel dome just blew my mind away, by far the best dessert I‚Äôve had in a while.

Finally I visited Burma x2 today for lunch and I just loved it!So, I'm reviewing this place based on 3 important things needed in a restaurant to get a 5 rating:1.Food - 5/52.Ambiance - 4.5/53.Service - 5/5Starting with the food,*Samosa Soup: A samosa broken down and added in a Burmese style broth which gives a tangy taste in your mouth. This is a perfect dish to start off your lunch!*Burmese Falafel: Moderately crispy from the outside and soft from within are these falafels in a an amazing and tasty gravy which comes in 8 mini pieces in a plate. This is a really tasty dish but pricy!*Lotus stem crisps: A perfect crispy munching chips made of lotus stem which is dusted with a desi masala to make it flavorsome.All the starters are also accompanied with 4 different types of sides which is filled with different flavors.*Dry Khowsuey: A narrow flat noodles with a subtle hint of coconut flavor mixed with other mild spices with crispy corn flakes. This is best taken with either a curry or some flavorsome sauces. This too is pricy but quite filling and easily serves two people.*Orange & Mango Infused Tea: This restaurant serves some amazing collection of teas which are so rich in flavor and very light. They literally have 5-6 pages of just tea in the menu with multiple varieties. However, most of them cost approximately 300/- which serves around 6 cups. It's all about the experience here of having some amazing tea which I highly recommend.*Smokey Avocado: This probably won me as I'm a huge fan of avocado's. A fine dessert which tastes exactly like avocado's mixed with a little honey. This is presented with some dry ice to make it look just fabulous. I highly recommended this dessert here.So, if you're going for 3 starters, 1 main course, 1 Signature Tea, and 1 dessert.. it's going to cost you approximately 2.5k!Then again, nothing disappointed me and the service was top notch. This restaurant have multiple options for vegan dishes and Jain friendly dishes. However, this restaurant doesn't take prior reservations. So, you have to wait approximately 30-45 minutes to get a table on a weekend.

As vegetarians we have limited choices when it comes to unique cuisines. Burma Burma is exclusively vegetarian and most of the dishes are practically vegan. Food: The Samosa soup was the first thing we tried and it was even better than expected. Next we moved on to Mopi Salai (pan fried dumplings served in a ‚Äòpaniyaram‚Äô pan) and Kyar Yor Thoke (Lotus root salad). Both were good. For the main course we tried ‚ÄòOh no Khowsuey‚Äô - a dish rich in coconut milk served with a variety of condiments. And despite the fact that we were bursting at the seams, we ordered the Smoked avocado icecream with honey caviar which was presented with a lot of (smokey) theatrics. Service: Excellent. Hygiene: Found it slightly wanting. Our first bowl of salad had hair in it which we thankfully spotted soon after we started eating. They replaced it with a fresh bowl.

It did not feel too heavy to the palatte as well. Then came in the lotus stem crisps that were cooked to perfection. The thin slices of lotus stem were served so crunchy that remained the same even after they cooled down. Then came the spicy paneer baos and oh my god, they just melted in our mouth!We obviously couldn't stop ourselves from ordering the Khao suey that came with the condiments and was just so yummy.

Really enjoyed here.We started off with the famous Samosa soup and a Pitcher of their purple drink it was just amazing, it was so flavorful and yum. Then for starters we had the open dumplings which was a different concept again and it was just mind blowing! The steamed buns were one of the best I have tasted till today. The sauces that they served on the table were also very good and not very spicy as they told.For the main course we were already so filled but yet we ordered their noodles and the black sticky rice. The noodles flavor was awesome and the sticky rice was something different and new, one can order this if you want to try something other than the usual.DESSERTS : The best part on the menu. We ordered for the avocado ice cream and the Madras kappi but the Madras kappi was not available and hence he was very sweet to give us their famous chocolate bomb on the house. Nothing can ever go wrong with the desserts, both were just amazing. Being only 4 of us we really over ate.Highly recommended and will definitely go back here soon.

The ambiance was splendid, with every corner and artefact displaying an exotic touch- ornate tea shelves with tea kettles, equipments, tea jars, Burmese toy figurines, eclectic collection of merchandise(looked like straight out of a Wes Anderson film like The Darjeeling Limited or Grand Budapest Hotel), interesting concrete ceiling lampholders, and contemporary concrete wall look. This raised our expectations sky high. We went with a Samosa Soup and Tea Leaf Salad for starters. The soup was great- very interesting level of spicy, a slight touch of sweet balancing the spice, and the crispiness of a very Indian samosa dunked in along with nuttiness of fresh greens and sprouts and black chana. It was unlike any broth based dish I have tasted before. The Tea Leaf Salad however, was quite underwhelming. The salad leaves looked and felt wilted, the only crunchiness was provided by an overuse/abuse of roasted nuts, which were more like the ones we get commonly in the street fried mixtures. For a Tea Leaf salad, my expectations were certainly higher than that. At the least I expected to taste the fermented/bitter tea leaves that would leave me with an experience of trying something exotic. But this tasted more like wilted lettuce drenched in vinegar and oil. And may be the crispy stuff can be served separately, so that people can add it as much as they would prefer. On to the mains, we went with the signature Oh No Khow Suey. It was quite aromatic, and all the things you expect from a good Khow Suey- fresh broth with a range of flavors from fresh greens, crispy garlic and onion shreds, dusted peanuts, wedge of lime. I liked that the gravy wasn‚Äôt thick and sweet, and had a nice sprinkling of chilli oil to not make you sleep while you finish the bowl. A word on the service. Although the staff was helpful with advice, it felt at times they were too intrusive, constantly asking us to order the next course. When you are out at a fine dine, you expect to take longer to absorb the menu and the place, and such service only tends to ruin your experience. Also, it felt like the staff was focusing more on the larger groups.¬†All in all, an average experience at a much touted exotic diner.

I was out with my girls on a bright Saturday afternoon in Indiranagar. As they were veggies and game to try out any cuisine, we decided on this place Burma Burma. It is located right smack opposite to The Pizza Bakery, and google location is accurate. It is a very unassuming place and its entryway reminded me of the Leaky Cauldron (get it, Harry Potter fans?). You won‚Äôt find it unless you are looking for it. We walked here, so am not sure of the parking situation. I believe there is a valet, but not 100% sure.¬†When we walked in at around 130 pm, the place was packed and the hosts graciously informed us that it might take us close to 15 minutes for a table. All 3 of us were really famished but seeing the crowd we decided that it might be worth the wait and decided to wait at the bar. We were given the menus and asked to go over it while we waited. This place is a restaurant and a tea room and as soon as you enter you see this display of tea and tea pots that are also for sale. Looks cute. The ambience is also nice and I especially liked the coloured umbrellas that were hanging in the ceiling. Pretty unique. The servers and the hosts are very polite and knowledgable on their menu. If you are confused as to what to order, just ask them and they will help you out. The service is also fast considering that they were fully occupies when we were there.The menu is a hotchpotch of Burmese delicacies. I was ignorant to the fact that the Burmese cuisine is so diverse and this place provided an apt education in that department. We wanted to try everything, but decided to take it one step at a time. For drinks, we ordered a pitcher of pomegranate and mandarin spritzer. If you are a large group, I would totally recommend you go for the pitcher as it gives 6 glasses of the drink easily. As for the drink itself, it was meh. This was my least favourite part of the meal. It was way too sour and the pomegranate seeds in it were not fresh. I could hardly taste the so called mandarin in the drink.¬†For starters, we ordered a raw mango salad. I actually saw this dish being ordered by some other table and asked the waiter for its name. Good call, that. The salad turned out to be delicious. Thin slices of mango with peppers, flavoured with a nice sweet and sour dressing and topped with crispy peanuts. Yummm! All 3 of us totally loved it. Would recommend this if you are a fan of raw food.For main course, we had their house speciality, the Burma Burma Oh No Khao Suey with hakka noodles. You do have the choice to try different noodles with the Khao Suey here but we went with the default option. Now, if you have read my reviews, I totally love Khao Suey and before this place, this was the only Burmese dish  that I knew of. This place, by far has the best khao suey that I have tasted so far. Totally. It is not too thick, very creamy and the flavour is just perfect. The condiments that accompany it is also very well made. One of my friends liked it so much that she was taking small sips of it through the entire meal just to make the flavour last.We also ordered the Burmese style stir fried vegetables. The sauce that was used was very nice and a little high on turmeric. We didnt mind it a bit. The flavour was nice but it was eclipsed by the amazing Khao Suey.¬†After all this, we were still hungry so we decided to go for the Burmese Fried Rice. This again was very well made. The rice was cooked just perfect and the veggies were cooked in such a way that it had a crispness to it. We really liked it.We were finally full after all this and decided with heavy hearts to skip the dessert. The total bill for the 3 of us was around INR 2600, which is a little on the higher side. So, if you want to treat yourself and try out a new cuisine, I would totally recommend you add a little Burmese to your menu and head over to this place.

I visited the place in a group of 16 people so we tried many different dishes. My expectations were pretty high because I heard a lot of positive reviews about Burma Burma. Starters were indeed amazing but we all were a bit disappointed by mains. They were not bad but didn't match most of our palates. One more disadvantage is the fact that it is not possible to book a table in advance. And considering the fact that this place is 90% of the time packed, makes it a bit inconvenient to visit because once you reach the place, you have to wait most of the time.Things to order:- any of the teas- crispy lotus chips- buns- sticky rice- samosa soup- coconut rice with tomatoes                                                                one90six.com",39974987, 4.0,                                                                    61 Posts

A bit of apprehension due to it being a veg only place followed by several occasions of disappointment due to long queues prevented me from trying it any sooner. We got in this time only because we reached there 10 mins before their doors even opened. Literally, no kidding. Within a matter of few minutes after opening they were close to full and people had already started queueing up.Anyways, we started with our Burmese food journey expecting a whole lot of things. We tried the 'best' or 'recommended' starters - Lotus stem crisps and pan fried dumplings. The chips were a good munching option but not a satisfactory appetizer. Neither of the starters stood out exceptionally for me.Moving on from this rather disappointing start, we went ahead with the mains. All thanks to their Khao Suey which made up for it all. This was something which I truly enjoyed and was very well balanced in flavor. You have an option to pick Udon, Hakka or whole wheat noodles to go in it. Served with a side topping plate consisting of peanuts, garlic etc you can load your dish as per your taste.For desserts, we tried their Banana chocolate mousse and was a winner for me. Decadent, smooth, beautiful looking dish made relishing this indulgence even more enjoyable.We tried their bubble tea and though I'm not a tea person at all, the tea experience is definitely recommended out here.Overall it was a decent experience and the last two dishes made me score them a 4 instead of 3. A good option for a vegetarian place(considering the far and few excellent all veg places).Not value for money but more of an experiential dining experience according to me. I'll probably skip the starters if I do visit this anytime again. But good job on your ambience and attentive service.

I see statement lamps the size of two elephant heads at the least, and there is a herd of them hung about. I immediately feel dressed down in the black athletic shorts I had raided from my husband's closet. Luckily, my friend had the good sense of wearing bata chappals. That helped.Once placed on our actual table, we were confronted with this menu consisting of samosa soups and other assortments - none of which we were accustomed to. I obviously settled for a tamarind cooler with coconut in it. Onkar orders the pomegranate-orange spritzer. This is followed by a gram flour-tomato-coconut khow suey. I did not let Onkar know about my love-hate relationship with tomatoes and am so glad I didn't because venturing out of comfort zone leads to greatness or something similar as per the Pinterest quote I was memorising the other day. We chowed down the whole affair in no time - just pausing for 'wow', 'love this' exclamations in between.¬†And then our server, Bhagyadhar, ushers in like Jeeves to serve us at the moment our plates looked empty-ish. Always with a smile that said - bet you like the food!And as soon as we were done, a bowl of imli candies accompanied the bill, which all made their way into my purse.I'll be back to sample the rest of the khow sueys.

And I‚Äôm always game for some Asian cuisine. Every time she‚Äôs in the city she‚Äôs makes it a point to visit an Italian, Asian, Mexican and a dessert place before going back. When she was here recently we were fixed on visiting Burma Burma Coz everyone I say everyone were talking about this place. Not to mention ‚Äúyou of all people should try this place‚Äù, yeah was getting this a lot. So, we decided to truth the place on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Not a difficult place to find, looked nothing fancy from the outside. Was made to wait for just a few minutes outside and then were shown into the restaurant. And as the door was opened and we entered the place, I was amazed by the ambiance of the place. Just beautiful and very Asian indeed. All the decor, the wall hangings, the showpieces made the place look fantastic !! The place was full, with people conversing in low tones and very much occupied with the food on their table. We were shown a to a nice comfy couch and given the menus. Honestly at first, I swear i didn‚Äôt know what I was looking at. Made no sense, didn‚Äôt know what to order. All I knew was that this place was a 100% vegetarian. As my sister and I were having a horrid time figuring out the menu, a person approached and asked if we needed assistance. We gladly accepted the offer and he started explaining the items on the menu. So each item is named in its Asian cuisine form but has been explained pretty well in detail below. So with his help and the description as well as based on what we were looking for, his suggestions clubbed with our need to explored finally managed to order. Firstly we shared a vegetable Thai soup. And then we tried 2 main courses - 1) Panthay Khowsuey also called the China town noodles, was tamarind flavoured with groundnuts & veggies. Tasted absolutely yummy. Delicious !! Mouth watering, probably one of the best Asian dishes I‚Äôve had. Before this I‚Äôve to tell you about the toppings tray- about 6-8 different types of options to top on your mains based on what your liking is and requirements to satisfy everyone for their own liking. So I actually don‚Äôt remember the exact options in the tray and the exact way each was explained, but will surely update the next time I visit this place again !! But makes a lot of difference and they are very authentic I‚Äôve heard. The 2) Oh No Kala Hin - is a coconut based vegetable red curry with a tinge of tamarind and red chillis giving it a unique flavour and aroma. It tasted brilliant as well with the jasmine sticky rice and was nothing like most of the Thai Curries I‚Äôve had. I actually liked both the dishes equally but my sister was more towards the noodles than the curry. The portions are good too and quite filling and satisfactory. Service is a bit slow but the ambiance will make you awww and you would forget looking at your watch. Finally the dessert. My sister had made her mind up to try this and this only, the all spoken about - Avacado Icecream. And believe me, the hypes all worth it‚Äôs the presentation is simply brilliant, and the taste is something else altogether. Both had a scoop each and left the place with a amazing feeling and the taste of a unique dishes & desserts. Altogether had an amazing (actually most of time I was into the menu trying to understand the different dishes). Must try place for all the Asian cuisine lovers and veggiesaurs‚Äô of course !!! Definitely going back a few couples of times atleast, have to try their tea as well and the many different options on their unique and tasty menu.

The samosa soup definitely works. I have been craving bubble tea forever and found these guys had that too. The fancy avacado ice fream with the liquid nitrogen gies beyond just theatrics and is creamy and lovely. They serve tea and also sell merchandise.Taste wise, loved all we ordered.

This adage is aptly exemplified by Burma Burma.As soon as we entered the restaurant , we were struck by the ambience. Simple but elegant. The place was quite crowded, but the smell of food over powered all other senses, which served to increase our craving.We ordered the zomato recommended samosa soup and lotus stems for starters. The soup was slightly on the spicier side, but the flavours were really brought out well enough by the chef. The lotus stems were cooked to the right shade of brown , which made them very crispy and they did go well with the different sauces on offer.We ordered khao suey, which was again very well prepared and brought out the subtle flavours of the Veges. The side garnishings added a nice burnt taste and a certain delightful crunchiness to the incredibly smooth texture of khao suey.We also tried the black rice. It was stickier than expected, but quite soft and good to taste and combined well with the tangy gravy suggested by the captain.Lastly, we ordered the avocado ice cream with honey cavier. The dish was a visual treat with white fumes emanating from it. The presentation was complete with honey caviar shaped like pearls in an oyster shaped dish. The ice cream was very smooth. The blandness of avocado was perfectly balanced by the subtle sweetness of the honey drops.Overall, Burma Burma was a good experience and I would certainly recommend you to visit it with your group of friends to enjoy this happening and youthful place.Food - 4Ambience- 4Staff - 4.5Overall - 4                                        ",39381395, 4.0,                                                                    142

Today was the fourth time that I went here and this was failed attempt as well. On weekends I admit there is a lot of rush and hours of waiting and we have waited for a while but left as the wait prolonged. Today being a holiday I was there at 1:00pm. There wasn't a single soul in waiting. I was alone. The staff opened the door and the place was fairly full. But I could see three empty tables. One 4 seater and 2 6 seaters. The staff asked me to take a seat at the bar. I said I am not very comfortable since it's at the entry and I can see a 4 seater table empty and It's just me so obviously you understand I wouldn't take too much of your time. Plus I have come here three other times so I don't want to miss this chance. If there was a waiting outside I wouldn't have suggested this. I said not the 6 seater you can give the 4 one( which was in the extreme corner). The staff kept on discussing with one then the other and then another .. after that .. "" you either sit on the bar and place your order or you can wait outside for 20-25 minutes till we have a small table"" Being a small part of this huge industry myself, I know one thing - customer experience is what makes or breaks us. I am not saying I won't ever go there. Maybe someday I will. As much as I know giving a 4 seater table to a single person isn't a huge business gain but a little smile on their faces when they denied me a table or a little courtesy wouldn't hurt anyone ?

After multiple failed attempts to get a table, we finally decided to wait it out of the days. And boy was the wait worth every minute!!! Being a non-vegetarian, I was a tad sceptical as to how good the food could actually be, this place is absolutely a must try.Updated:Ambience: (5/5)It‚Äôs a beautiful space with multiple design elements that bring out the Burmese/Oriental feel of the place. The walls are textured and the lights are exquisite. Food: (5/5)Visit 1:The Tom Yum soup was great, but it comes in a close second behind the Siracha at UB City. The green tea rice, however, was in a league of its own. Never really expected rice to have the flavour that was presented. It was so unique my brain needed time to process the explosion of flavours in my mouth. The portions were also great for 2 people on one dish. Honestly all the descriptions sounded so good, clearly you need to come in a group to do justice to all that‚Äôs on offer. Visit 2:The time around had the Samosa soup which was brilliant - a bunch of tamarind made it tangy and the samosa balances the tangy flavour well. Had the Wa Potato starter which was excellent. The partially roasted garlic was excellent. The Chinese noodles were one of the best I have had till date. Finally the rice, which was perhaps my least favourite dish of the lunch. All in all the flavours were great and very different from my first visit. However the quality and taste of the food just seems to keep getting better. Summary: (5/5)One of my new favourite spots in bangalore with it excellent food and beautiful ambience. Definitely worth the wait.

We ordered several other starters too - like the Burmese naan and paratha with Tohu which was basically an Indo-Burmese dish, mango salad - I usually don't eat salads but this one was honestly so fresh and tasty.For drinks, we had Oreo, Nutella and mint bubble tea- the Nutella bubble tea was the best with tiny chocolate bubbles balls of joy which came with every sip.We were so full with starters that we decided to go light on main course that we ordered only one portion of sticky wok-fried rice and noodles which were so so good that I can't describe.And finally for dessert, we had Smoked honey and avocado ice cream and the Burma Bomb. The smoked ice cream was truly a sight and tasted fruity (Check out next post üòâ). But the Burma Bomb was a disappointment- with the description on the menu we'd expected a huge bomb like structure but it turned out to be small dome of Chocolate with chocolate sauce and dust filled with chocolate ice cream!Well non-vegetarians please note that they serve PURELY VEG dishes.

I think coming here once is injustice for the place considering everything we tried was awesome starting with the Yuzu bubble tea and the Burmese falafel , sticky rice with stir fried vegetables and the dessert - tagu pyi an ! The staff was very courteous and warm, happy to provide recommendations. It is also a tea room, an aspect I still need to explore. Family friendly and couple friendly place.¬†Ambience: 4/5Food: 5/5Service: 4.5/5Value for money: 4/5X-Factor: 5/5                                                            ",38805429, 5.0,                                                                    59

But I didn't find the food anything special or authentic.They got really good interiors, and its a myth to get a table there. We finally got a table for dinner on one of the weekdays, without having to wait.Food was good, not so great though. We were quite not sure on what to order, so based on staff recommendations and food bloggers who had been there before . Ordered for Bubble tea, which was nice. As per recommendation, we ordered for Lotus stem, Samosa soup and Pan fried chinese noodles. Didn't like the samosa soup, wasn't so great. The noodles were okay.For desserts, we thought to go for Avocado Ice cream, as it was one of the most recommended desserts, and its served in a fancy bowl way along with Liquid nitrogen in a theoretical way. It was nice ; didn't feel like we were having ice cream, you can feel the taste of the fruit itself, not too sweet . This is a WINNER.Ambiance was definitely good, advanced. Staff is good and service was prompt.Would recommend this place for vegetarians mostly. üëç                                        ",38771288, 5.0,                                                                    98

Eye catching for sure.BB is an all veg no booze space and yet the place was totally packed during lunch. Well the mainstay here is SE. Asian with a focus on Burmese, which is not very accessible as a cuisine! So that's interesting.My companion had visited this place like half a dozen times, so we decided to order things she hadn't tried before. So their popular items like Samusa Soup, Khao Sway etc were not considered!To drink we ordered a Yuzu bubble tea and a pot of Lavender Tea and for starters a Guava Salad and a rice dumpling.The yuzu tea was good and refreshing, with mild citrus notes, but the Lavender Tea was a killer! you get a nice hit of the delicate lavender and I truly enjoyed it. They served it with a little bowl of sunflower seeds, which was fab!The Guava Salad came like within of minute of ordering, which made us wonder, if we got someone's cancelled order! As a salad, it had chunks of the fruit in a sour spicy peanut dressing. I thought the taste was very one note for my palate and needed a little bit of sweetness to round it off!Oddly the rice dumplings (which are like the kuyipaniyarams, we get in tamilnadu), suffered from the same issue! Each of the pan fried balls is topped with a large dollop of papaya salad, which while crunchy and fresh, was wee bit too sour for me.Next up we got a steamed bun with a mixed veg filling and a sticky rice with mushrooms. While I liked the bun, the minced veggie filling was OK, the saving grace was the sticky rice, where finally the mushroom curry filling was an explosion of flavours and tasty and went great with the dipping sauce.We concluded the meal with their showy avocado icecream, where we were warned that the dry ice was for display only! LOLI didn't quite understand the serving mode, if the icecream came on top a bed of dry ice, it would have had an better impact (?), but why on the side!?! that head scratching moment aside, the ceramics used were so beautiful and the icecream was really creamy and interesting.The well put together service staff was accommodating and friendly throughout and the food comes like super fast. We asked them to pace it a little, which they complied.Well honestly, overall the food while decent, didn't quite hit the spot, I was anticipating; also prices here isn't exactly cheap. We paid about 3K for our meal. Maybe I need to revisit and try their classics at another time?Decor-8Food-7Service-8.5Overall-8Giving it a 4, but 3.5 is more apt...

As you walk in you see a very traditionally done up place which has certain modern elements to it. The place itself has a separate counter for tea as well which seemed pretty interesting to us. It was also pretty crowded considering LBB had called quite a few people to the place and it was a Friday night.SoupTo start the meal they served us a Samosa Soup. It tasted like some sort of well spiced Rasam served with a couple of Mini Samosas. The crispiness of the shell of the Samosa along with the soft potato filling complimented the soup very well.SaladGenerally we wouldn‚Äôt ideally choose a Salad over an appetizer but kudos to the chef. We were given a Tea Leaf Salad and Raw Mango Salad. The Tea Leaf Salad was easily one of the best Salads we have ever had. The fermented tea leaves along with the crunchiness and flavour of the Fried Garlic Nuts tasted unlike anything we have ever had before. The raw Mango Salad also tasted great when paired with the Red Chilly and Brown Onion.AppetizersIn the next course we were given Lotus Stem Crisps, Tohu Mash with Paratha and Crunchy Tofu Steamed Buns. The Lotus Stem Crisps worked great as a start as they are chips seasoned with Paparika and Curry Leaves. The only problem we had was the portion size was rather large even for four people. The Tohu Mash was the perfect side to the flaky Parathas which they served. The presentation for this dish was something that particularly stood out for us. The Steamed Buns were easily the highlight of the course as we had never had anything quite like that before. The buns were very soft and slightly sticky which worked perfectly for the crispy fried Tofu Patty. It looked great and tasted even better.Main CourseFor the mains we were given Burma Burma ‚ÄúOh no Khow Suey‚Äù, Brown Onion and Roasted, Chilli Grilled Sticky Rice and the Stir Fried Seasonal Greens with Tofu. The Khao Suey was easily the highlight of the day for us. The flavours and textures in that particular dish easily made it one of the best Khao Sueys we have ever had. Grilled Sticky Rice was cooked perfectly and the brown onion added a distinct taste however, it did not work when it was paired with the Stir fried Tofu Gravy. We felt the Tofu was quite overcooked and the entire broth was loaded with too many overpowering elements. Unfortunately, we could not finish this dish as it did not taste good at all.DessertFor the final part of our meal we were given Smokey Avocado Honey Caviar Ice Cream and the Tagu Pyian. The Avocado Ice Cream had very good presentation as it was served on dry ice hence the smokiness of the ice cream was achieved. It tasted pretty good for an ice cream as it was our first time trying out avocado flavoured ice cream. The Tagu Pyian tasted rather peculiar as it is a Sago cooked with Palm jiggery and served with Coconut Custard. It was a weird kind of sweetness which didn‚Äôt particularly appeal to our palate but that is purely a personal preference.Final VerdictA place which is done up so well and offers something unique unlike anything you can find in the city for sure. This place offers a one of a kind experience so we would certainly recommend all the food lovers out there to try it out. It would be perfect for a family night out or for a date as well as it offers a relaxed and fun environment.Food: 4.5/5Price: 4/5Ambience: 5/5Service: 4/5                                        ",38719017, 4.0,                                                                    118

Well behaved staff including the manager who is nice. This place offers Burmese food with an Indian twist. We had a lot of things here...the food is generally tangy and a bit salty. We ordered bread and I think I have to say that the bows of fatty bow wins over these bows here. The dessert we tried was a bit of a dissapointment. We ordered durian ice cream and cocopina. The cocopina was the better of the two. The samosa soup splits is highly recommended. The Burmese falafel was average. The china town noodles was the winner in the mains even though you might get a similar tasting dish at other places. The mushroom ricellings were unique.Overall this place is always full with people and one should be prompt with bookings to find a place. It certainly lives up with all other places on 12th main despite of being a vegetarian only place. The staff always warns you about the taste before you place the order, which I found nice.

Amidst many classy restaurants out there this place has it's own tunes.Besides providing the most required facality of the city i.e. wallet parking, this restaurant attempts to swing your vote in it's favour for its relaxed zen-like ambience. And the food that makes your eyes go nubilous.What's best on their menu?-----------------------------------------1. Samosa soup: Ever heard of it? Well, they say that's what got them started into what they are today. Lemon, ginger, peas, veggies and a samosa dunked right in middle of a translucent broth of Burmese spices!2. Raw mango salad:(Tayat Thi Thoke) Iff, you have had got enough over regular salads, give a try. It was as close to our Indian raw mango salad, just that the ambience added a ting of Burmese flavor to it. Too pricy for just a raw mango though.3. Rice Dumblings: For the starters, this would look exactly like phaddu/paniyaar/gundu pangla. But it's only when your buds get a first splash of sauces, you ought to realise- Oh! It's Burmese.4. BURMA BURMA OH NO KHOW SUEY: No Burmese food is completely without khow suey. Isn't it?Hakka noodles with forey of toppings and served with a bowl of veggies cooked in coconut milk.5. Avacado ice cream: I was taken aback whilest reading the dish on their menu for I had only seen it been demonstrated on culinary shows that often ran into disaster. But hey, not here.Overall, Refreshing nouvelle asian menu that is ¬†light on tummy, bit heavy on your credit card statement.Report card:-----------------------------------------1. Taste: 5/52.

Well we found a seat and immediately started deciphering this very impressive menu, which has a whole section decorated to teas! Nice!So we started with the very recommended samosa soup with a sample of starters. Which were very good. Then went for pan fried dumplings, which I recommend eating in one bite because the explosion of flavours is quite mind boggling. We topped it off with brown onion brown buns. Excellent choices but we were quite full pretty quick and actually debated if we wanted to go for the main course.That‚Äôs when we ordered a khao suey. The first time I have tried a vegetarian khao suey and it wasn‚Äôt bad. However, I think the idea of a preassembled khao kind of defeats the purpose. Overall, worth the wait and the hype.

I definitely recommend the Pan fried dumplings and chickpeas Tohu(reminds me of chilli paneer) , dint enjoy the steamed buns that much. The Burma Burma Khaosuey was good but the best was the smoked avocado ice cream. We also tried Pu-erh tea which was lovely.

This place was quoted as best restaurant for serving pure veg asian and burmese food. So it was a must try.Taste: Order anything and i am sure you won't be disappointed. This place also serves jain food for all the people who wish to eat a different cuisine. I ordered Jain pan fried dumplings which were just so delicious. Imagine it was ordered twice! Now you may understood how delightful it would have tasted. Also since we were only two of us, we couldn't order much. So next was Jain red chilly friend rice. It was obviously on a spicier side but was really a treat for our tongue. I have heard of avocado ice cream alot so i ll will be going there soon to try it again alot with other dishes which I couldn't try.Ambience: The place is amazingly decorated with alot of tea pots kept and fun pop of color. It has an auro of it's own. The lamps, chairs and walls are really appealing asian and burmese style.Service: since the menu has names and descriptions you really can't understand if you are not into too much of exotic ingredients then don't worry. The staff here will explain you everything. They are really friendly.P.S: It is super crowded all the time so make sure either go a little ahead of their opening time or don't hesitate to wait for 10-15 mins. It is surely worth the wait!                                        ",37669029, 4.0,                                                                    17

Just goes to show how amazing their food is.The food - EVERYTHING here is absolutely perfect-among the best Burmese we've had. We could see and smell all the dishes around us and wished we weren't already stuffed, so that we could order more - 100% recommend the samosa soup, tea leaf salad and the bubble tea.

A completely veg resto on the 12th main Indiranagar.Ambiance: I just loved the vibrant interiors where the base colours are orange yellow and red, tastefully done interiors and comfortable plush seating.Food: We were quiet not sure on what to order, so had to go for the recommendations from the staff and the food bloggers who had already been here. While we were deciding what to order, thought we‚Äôll order a couple of drinks to start off such as Nutella bubble tea and eldragon. Eldragon was light and refreshing with coconut water n dragon fruit. The bubble tea was also good since I had a Nutella one for the first time. As per the suggestions we went for the samosa soup, which was good and it‚Äôs amazing that the samosa was still crunchy. For starters it was steam buns with tofu, pan fried dumplings. Wow what a dish was the steam buns, I could‚Äôve eaten all 4 of them and happily left, the patty just crunchy. Didn‚Äôt like the pan fried dumplings though, wasn‚Äôt so great. Mains was the not so know suey with different accompaniments, do try this if you like khow suey. Well we were waiting for desserts and when it was time, ordered three different kinds. The most obvious being the avocado ice cream, no words can describe the amazing taste where you feel you are actually eating the fruit itself; perfect not too sweet too and a little theatrical display with the dry ice for the added effect. Next was the Burma bombe which had a chocolate sphere filled with cake pieces, caramel and choco sauce. We tried another dish- coconut panacotta. The clear winner was definitely the avocado ice cream, all dishes were equally good. We couldn‚Äôt try the different teas they had.Service: knowledgeable staff who knows well about each dish, who suggest and advise to your needs.Would definitely visit again for some veggie Burmese dose.

Next we ordered dimsum with mushrooms and the pan-fried rice dumplings.While the dimsum was just plain disappointing, the rice dumplings were basically just a glorified South Indian paniyaram, and we would much rather have the original than this really dry and bland version. Up next was the signature khow suey which was alright, but we'd recommend the one at On The Edge over this one any day.Long story short, Burma Burma does not live up to its hype, and we'd recommend skipping this one in favour of more authentic and just plain tastier alternatives in the city.

I understand there is a lot of demand to dine here and they can‚Äôt accommodate everyone so there is a lot of waiting for the table, no reservations and a general rush to dine fast and leave because other customers are waiting.

Either that, or you plan to be there as early as 12:00pm.I tried the seabuckthorn drink. First I had to Google seabuckthorn to know what it is. üòÇ But whatever it was, the drink was sweet, spicy, salty and sour at the same time. I wouldn't recommend the charcoal tea unless of course, you have a taste for ash. üò∑We decided to skip main course and sample all their starters. We ordered the raw mango salad which is one of the best salads I've tasted so far. Crunchy peanuts and the sourness of the mango pair well with the freshness of the rest of the ingredients. We also ordered steam buns, Lotus stem crisps, pan fried dumplings and tofu bhurji with parotas . The lotus stem chips were a little salty for my taste but my friends couldn't have enough. The tofu stir fry was so amazing I wish I had forgotten my manners and liked the bowl clean.For desserts, we tried the avocado icecream and the coconut pudding. A refreshing end to the meal.It is a little highly priced. For all this, for about 5 people, we paid 1000 per head. The ambience is very nice and seating is comfortable. Service is good as well.

But finally when they arrived, I knew they‚Äôd be too much (the Khow Suey portion was especially generous), so I got half of both packed and shared with my colleagues later. They found the food delicious too.I‚Äôm glad they have a separate menu where Vegan dishes are marked. But it would be nice if they just added the Vegan key to the main menu instead of us having to ask for the Vegan one. We need the world to see just how many amazing Vegan options there can be. :)Very much looking forward to visiting again and tasting more of the delicious offerings at this place.

Went for a mid week lunch at a recommendation of somebody who raves about their Gurgaon branch, and were surprised to find it almost full by 1300. Lovely mid sized restaurant with a decor that reminds one of the old years, the mountains, the rice and paddy fields. The service staff is attentive without being intrusive, and knowledgeable (you‚Äôd be surprised to see the number of restaurants where the service staff have no understanding of their menu, the dishes and it‚Äôs ingredients).

It being a Monday evening, the crowd was fairly moderate but one can imagine how it may be during the weekend evenings. The place has three levels of seating and we chose a table in the AC section on the ground floor.The ambiance was nice while the decor was that of an old school pub with strong, broad wooden furniture and fixtures. They play the English classics which worked very well for us and the staff was polite. I wasn't too pleased with the speed of service though.We ordered the following: Chicken overloaded nachos (disappointing since there was little chicken or flavour of chicken and more baked beans), onion rings (average), jalapeno cheese balls (they were good as the cheese was definitely molten and gooey), non-veg platter (this was delicious too as the pieces were succulent and had distinct flavours, especially the mutton sheekh kebab and the mutton tikka), wheat beer, special brew (their second strongest beer after stout), brandy and a couple of other alcoholic beverages. They had the 1+1 offer on alcoholic beverages. Strangely though, they did not have the stout beer despite it not being a busy evening.The pricing was largely at par with other such microbreweries in Bangalore. The portions were decent too. Overall, it was a good place strictly basis the ambiance and the quality of the non-veg platter.

The place was crowded as its Friday, upon our request they made sure to provide a seating for 2 in 3rd floor. So people if u plan to hit up this place on a Friday evening, make sure you have a reservation. Old rock and pop music are the choice of tracks that is mostly played in here.  We choose to have Vodka with orange juice to toast for the friendship that evening. Which was served quickly.We choose to have BBQ Chicken wings and fish tikka to have along with the drink.

Had booked a place in the Smoking zone and they had reserved the corner most table which had a view of the nice moving traffic of Bangalore.The Decor is contemporary but the place feels a bit cluttered.The service time was too long for every order.Shots took nearly an hour to come.Food tasted good.We ordered for a Veg Platter, Onion Rings, Cajun Patato and Wildling Mushroom Pizza.Had in-house beers and Mocktails(Rivet and Fruit Martini)Have visited the place multiple times in the past and would visit again in future but they could really do with a little more space on the floor and a faster service.

On weekends, table reservation is highly adviced or you may face a good wait time.Being a beer lover this place was always in the bucket list as it happens to be one of the best breweries in the city. You can first try out samples and then go for your beer. We ordered three samples and then finally went for Bangalore bolt. In food we ordered overloaded nachos, tandoori prawns, chicken n cheese spring rolls, fish n chips, parmesan chicken and finally coastal sauteed chicken. Food was fairly good with parmesan chicken and prawns being the stand apart dishes.The ghee roast chicken and fish n chips complimented well with the drinks. The only disappointment for me was the nachos cause of its lack of flavour and had weird smell of the sour cream.The portion and presentation of the dishes were impressive and so was the quick service of the staff. Three floors of seating area with live match screenings and delicious beer makes it a popular chilling place for the young and old.

It is quite different in terms of the ambiance it provides - dark, rustic, kind of old school model with lots of woods and pipes. This is the place that is reminiscent of your good old days of 80s/90s. You should definitely try the apple cider it has on menu after a long weary day. It is one of its kind sweet beer but has got some trip to it. Prost is definitely one of my favorite breweries in Bengaluru. Amazing food especially nachos, chicken wings, and cheesy pepperoni pizza that would just melt in your mouth. This place has 3 floors - try for the roof top if you want to enjoy amazing Bengaluru weather along with good music and friends. Definitely worth a visit and well deserved 5 stars.

Soyrizo is the vegetarian version of chorizo, made with soy chunks. The grilled tortilla was filled with sumptuous cheese and soyrizo.Next was my favorite Mexican food; Tacos. The Grilled Chicken Tacos were loaded with cheese, onions, salsa, cream, and jalapenos. DELICIOUS.The final dish was the Roasted Zucchini Corn Burrito Bowl. The bowl looked scrumptious once I tossed the ingredients. Rice, beans, cheese, salsa, jalapeno, and sour cream added a perfect flavor to the zucchini and corn base.One more item that you should try is their extremely refreshing Fresh Lime Soda.The attendants were prompt with the orders.

Slightly bigger than the Indiranagar branch, the place was less crowded as well on the Sunday evening. The place has a very simple ambience with white walls and yellow furniture. There is a small vertical garden near the entrance. There are tables and benches for the seating, with place brightly lit up by small bulbs. We occupied a place near the glass wall overlooking the window.Food and Beverages:We started with Corn and Green Pepper Quesadillas which were a bit dry to eat but tasty on the other hand. The quantity was a bit less I felt. Then we tried Zucchini and Corn Enchiladas which was an absolute delight to have. Perfectly made corn tortillas dipped in tomato salsa was like a carnival in mouth.For desserts we tried the traditional Churros. I have a love and hate relationship with Churros, love the texture and taste in general but the cinnamon is one overpowering flavor in churros, nevertheless I liked it.Among beverages, we tried Mexican Spiced Hot Chocolate and Caf√© Con Leche.

(not for the light-hearted). Another must-try drink is the Tamarind Iced Tea which is a refreshing drink with the perfect amount of zest! Tostadas: Are flat crispy corn tortillas with your choice of topping. We tried the bean and cheese and it was delicious!Grilled tacos, our new favourite: We think it's actually fried and then maybe grilled. We had the chicken grilled taco. It was perfect.Burrito: If you are a spinach lover like myself to try the spinach and Caramelised onion burrito. Burritos are very healthy and filling option at Chinita. We have tried most of the vegetarian burritos and all of them are really good.Churros: Are just fantastic, the chocolate dip served with it is just heavenly!Chocolate Chili Cake: If you love dense and intense chocolate cakes, this is for you. It has a nice chilli aftertaste which is very interesting. Quesadillas: Their mushroom quesadillas are divine, if you're a quesadilla fan like us, you will definitely love this!

Refreshing and paired well with the food.Chicken Nachos 4.5/5 Heavily loaded. Not a lot of cheese but there's plenty of salsa, beans, sour cream and jalapenos along with the choice of topping.Guacamole 4/5 To me, a dollop of guacamole elevates the grub, be it nachos, tostadas or tacos. It's not very expensive and not difficult to make. Guacamole to mexican food is what podi is to Andhra meals and chutney to idli and dosa. Dont make your guests order it as an add on.Burrito Bowl 4.5/5 A layered bowl of flavoured rice, beans, salsa, jalapenos, choice of topping, cheese and sour cream. A wholesome meal.I've on other occasions had the pleasure of trying the quesedillas, enchiladas and the mole as well.

So when we had to step out today we were toying between Chinese Italian or punjabi, when we got this brilliant suggestion - Mexican.  Our first visit left us longing for more. We ordered all standard Mexican fares from nachos to burritos to enchiladas to tacos. The tase was absolutely bang on. It reminded us of Don Pablo‚Äôs back in US. The best happened at last when we ordered flan which is a very opulent form of pudding. We could not try out one of their best sellers - churros.

The food remains authentic Chinese in most dishes and some dishes do of course cater to the Indian flavour pallet as well, wherein the Chef has made a good balance between the spices and flavours across borders.While I honestly can't fault any of the dishes as they were all exceptional, some dishes that I could have on the daily are;Sesame Prawn Toast:This dish for me is the star dish, they have managed to pull off a very difficult task of keeping it, moist, succulent, crisp and flavourful.Sichuan Chili Pepper Chicken:While the name of the dish might seem common, the flavours certainly aren't. The use of authentic Sichuan chilli shines right through and while the dish is spicy it's so delicious you'd overlook the sweat running down your forehead.dimsums:I tried both vegetarian and non-vegetarian versions and they were all different in taste but consistent in the soft and thin outer layer which left you feeling light and craving for more.Mushroom and corn Jasmine fried rice: this dish is a testament, that something so simple can be so flavourful and comforting. The dish can be paired with any of their main course offerings with ease or can be had as is.Chilli garlic Hunan noodles:A perfect meal by itself, high on spice but great in taste, a must try.Hot-chocolate cookie over fudge:Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate with marshmallows to add a creamy texture and a cookie at the base, for a crunch element. While chocolate remind the hero of the dish the addition of different textures makes the dish both look and taste great.Passion coconut lime shortcake:This dessert was so different from the regular it had more sour notes than sweet which suit my pallet perfectly, I just refused to share.Mahjong though new seems to already be making it's Mark, if you're looking for a soul comforting meal this is certainly a must try.

Water Chestnut Dumplings - Served hot were these perfect combo of water chestnut and spinach with an amazing presentation. This really went well with the sweet chilli sauce rather than the soya sauce.4. Mushroom and Corn Fried Rice - This is a must if you like mushrooms with the combination of jasmine rice and corn. This dish was very tasty with a subtle essence of the well cooked rice. A perfectly cooked dish which goes really well with a gravy based side.5. Mapo Tofu - With small chunks of silken tofu which were really soft in a black bean and chilli based gravy. This went really well with both fried rice and noodles.6. Noodles - Tried two types of noodles, one being the chilli garlic noodles which were just average. This was basically a hakka based short noodles. However, the pan fried noodles were just amazing with the right balances of flavors.7. Hot chocolate cookie over fudge - This is a must have for all the chocolate lovers out there. With a couple scoops of ice cream, some glazed marshmellos, a yummy cookie is this delicious dessert for every sweet tooth.8. Passion coconut lime shortcake - A very fruity dessert with a combo of passion fruit, coconut and ice cream. This is definitely not everyone and only to people who'll appreciate fruit based dessert.9. Mahjong nuts: A lovely mini snack which resembles the peanut chikki. All kind of nuts mixed in a caramelized sugar mixture are these Mahjong nuts.Apart from the food served here they also have a wide collection of mocktails and cocktails to try which gives a very unique taste.

I recently came across the blue tea flower and fell in love with it. It's fun to see the whole tea changing color when the pH changes (squeeze some line).   It's a visual dramaCrunchy Corn Kernels - A light start and cant go wrongCrispy Lotus Stem Kernels - Good crunch and play of flavorsSesame prawn toast - The sesame flavor really highlighted the prawns. I loved this Sichuan Chilli pepper chicken - I love all things sichuan. There you goGong Bao Chicken with dry chili, peanut, sugar and vinegar -¬† ¬†A nice fun bursts of spice and sweet on the palate. Fun dishHot and Spicy Hunan prawns - I got stuck with hot and prawns. My favMushroom and Corn jasmine fried rice - There is something about Jasmine rice that appeals to the taste. In fact I can have Jasmine rice even just steamedMapo Tofu with lack bean and chili flakes - Very fresh and silky tofu that will perfectly be a favourite among the vegetarians. Great flavors with the sensuousness of the tofu on the tongueChili Garlic Noodle with Spring Onion - I love the simplicity of chilli garlic noodle which ideally does not even need any accompaniments. This place does complete justice to itIn cocktails I had their version of LIT and  found it pretty neat.  The one called Baiju with salted caramel was weird for me but that's my take. Hot Chocolate Cookie over Fudge - With Irish cream it was as boozy as it could get. It is sheer pleasure with every spoonPassion Coconut Lime Cake - My favourite for a surprising reason, the coconut liqueur which took it to a whole new level.

The name Mahjong is from a Chinese tile-based game that developed during the Qing Dynasty and is popular across the world now. The restaurant served food from different regions of China, especially Cantonese, Hunan and Sichuan along with few others. This new restaurant has an elegant and classy ambience with courteous and welcoming staff.We were welcomed with some crunchy nuts and kimchi. Along with that, they served us, Butterfly Pea Tea - which is a natural blue tea prepared by infusing petals of Clitoria ternatea flower (also known as butterfly pea flower or aparajita), dried lemongrass and mint. The tea had a unique blue colour and a distinct floral and earthy taste. On addition of lemon(citric acid) into this tea, it turns purple with a decrease in the pH level and that reminded of my Chemistry lessons in high school.Most of the starters that we tried were amazing as well. Loved the Crunchy Corn Kernels and Crisp Lotus Stem with Sesame among the Veg options. The Corn Kernels were perfectly fried to give it the crunchiness, the lotus stems though a little sweet for me was delicious as well. The Sichuan Chilli Pepper Chicken tasted well but was a little dry. The Chicken Sui Mai with the accompanying sweet chilli sauce and wonderfully crispy Golden Fried Prawns were the highlights among the appetisers.¬†We had some high expectations after the starters but were let down by some of the dishes in the main course. The steamed jasmine rice wrapped in lotus leaf was wonderful and had a unique flavour coming from the lotus leaf. The stir-fried Chinese greens consisting of brocolli, pok choy, lotus stems etc was well prepared as well as Crisp River Sole with Oyster Sauce. Loved the fish dish. The Gong Bao Chicken was decent, but nothing special. The two items that were disasters were the Home Style Noodles and Shredded Lamb with capsicum, onion and cumin. I am sorry to say, I rarely had such bad noodles and the Shredded Lamb was not good at all. It tasted extremely bland with a lot of cumin powder added it give it some taste and flavour. Though the jasmine rice complemented the taste, but still need improvement. The staff took the feedback positively and I hope they try to fix these areas.The desserts were so amazing that it momentarily made us forget about the noodles and the lamb. We tried the Passion Coconut Lime Shortcake, Date Pancake with Ginger Ice Cream, Salted Caramel Pudding with Tender Coconut Ice Cream and Hot Chocolate Cookie over Fudge Sundae. All the desserts were innovative, well presented and delicious. The combinations they made were simply brilliant. My favourites among these were the Date Pancake with Ginger Ice Cream and the Passion Coconut Lime Shortcake. The desserts made the experience even wonderful.

With Chinese-style flower vases decking the wooden tables and that quintessential red carpet, the decor of Mahjong is very Oriental, simple and functional.The menu serves a variety of typical Chinese dishes, vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I was here recently with a bunch of foodie friends, and had a lovely experience overall.Here is a short recount of the food we tried out:Crispy Lotus Stem With Sesame - Quite a common starter at several Thai and Chinese eateries, Mahjong's version was very well done. The lotus stem was sliced super thin, fried perfectly, tossed in a delicious sauce, the sesame seeds adding to the texture of the dish. The taste of this appetiser was slightly on the sweeter side, but it suited my tastebuds just fine.Crunchy Corn Kernels - This, again, is quite a commonly found appetiser in several barbecue outlets and Chinese eateries, with the Mahjong version being very beautifully done. The corn was just perfectly fried, neither overly chewy nor too crisp. I loved the taste of this starter!Butterfly Pea Tea - We opted for a pot of butterfly pea 'blue' tea, tea infused with the butterfly pea flower native to some Asian countries, which releases its blue colour when put into hot water. The fun part is that the water changes colour when an acidic substance - like lemon - is added to it. I recently had the opportunity to try this tea out in Thailand, and it was lovely getting reacquainted with it at Mahjong. It added an element of surprise and mystique to our table, which we loved.Lotus Leaf Jasmine Rice - I have always been fascinated by the concept of cooking with leaves, so this particular dish peaked my curiosity. We were served jasmine rice - which is quite fragrant by itself - cooked in a lotus leaf - the leaf infusing the rice with its gorgeous scent. This dish came in a bamboo basket, quite charmingly. I loved this beautifully fragrant jasmine rice, which went very well with the couple of main course dishes we chose.Stir-Fried Chinese Greens With Minced Garlic - This was a very simply done dish, which felt quite bland.Mapo Tofu With Black Bean & Chilli Flakes - Here, silky mapo tofu was cooked in a gravy, flavoured with black bean. The black bean smell was too overpowering for me, so I couldn't really relish this dish.Home-Style Noodles - This was a simple noodle dish, cooked with some veggies, the way one would do at home. It was pretty basic, and felt quite bland.Date Pancake With Ginger Ice Cream - This was one of the desserts we ordered, which turned out to be extremely lovely. Crispy-fried pancakes with a chewy date filling inside, served with ice cream that had flecks of spicy ginger in it - the textures, the flavours were simply beautiful!Passion Coconut Lime Shortcake - This had a crushed coconut macaroon, topped with some tender coconut and passionfruit ice cream, served with a sour lime drizzle. The sweet and sour notes of this dessert were just lovely, and this turned out to be my most favourite dish of the afternoon!Hot Chocolate Cookie Over Fudge - I absolutely loved this dessert, with a sticky chocolate chip cookie served with warm chocolate sauce, dark chocolate ice cream and s'mores. Again, the play of textures and flavours was brilliant!Salted Caramel Pudding With Tender Coconut Ice Cream - A nice concept, yes, but taste-wise, this paled in contrast to the beautiful desserts we tried out here earlier. This didn't go on to charm me, like the rest of the desserts did, sadly.I loved the starters we chose, and was mightily impressed with most of the desserts we ordered. My main course experience was sort of lacklustre, except for the jasmine rice. I'm guessing this wouldn't have been the case had we chosen a different set of main course dishes. Anyways, I love the variety of vegetarian dishes Mahjong has on the menu, and I can't wait to go back again to sample more of them!

We were group of 8 and the afternoon was about discussing our travel stories. The ambiance was perfect for such an afternoon.As we were quite a few people we had option to order quite a few dishes. Starting with obviously the tea. We tried the Blue peppermint tea..!! And while talking away all of us lost count of the cups of tea we drank. It was well prepapred and was smooth to have. In starters we had 1.crunchy corn kernels - which was different from other places in a nice way.2.crisp lotus steam with sesame - my favourite dish, it was on the sweeter side but I completely enjoyed it.3.sichuan chilli pepper chicken- also very nice and tasty4.chicken and onion Sui Mai- i love dimsums when it has the soupy feeling when you bite in and this was just like that. I completely loved it.5.Golden Fried Prawns- the prawns was good in size which is most important in this dosh and also the batter was perfect not too thick.Now going to the mains, I actually liked the starters more than the mains but it again depends from person to person.We had:1.stir fried chinese greens with minced garlic- it was very basic , but I usually prepare this at home aswell so for me it was nice.2.crispy river sole in oyester sauce- this was very nice the fish was well cooked.3. Gong Bao chicken- the best dish in the main we ordered. 4. Shredded Lamb with Cumin- this dish did not work for my Palate. The Cumin was over powering and did not quite go with the chinese flavours.5. Jasmine Rice- the flavour was so nice, exactly like it should be. The rice added so much to all the dishes.6. Home style noodles - this was also very basic.Now the Desserts, there was so much variety and they all were very nice:1.date pan cake with ginger ice cream- I loved the hint of ginger in this dessert.2.hot chocolate cookie over fudge- this desert is paired with Bailey‚Äôs and was extremely chocolicious3.

Fresh veggies were perfectly sauteed to perfection. Sole fish was also decent in taste, rest all are just average and needs huge improvements. Especially lamb, chicken and most importantly noodles. Shredded lamb was extremely bland and the gravy tasted like water. They need to infuse more flavor to it. Noodles was a disaster.Coming to dessert,Passion coconut lime shortcakeDate pancake with ginger ice-creamHot chocolate cookie over fudge sundaeThe best part of the meal I would say. In love with their date pancake with ginger ice cream and coconut lime shortcake. First time I had ginger ice cream and it was mind-blowing.

This is definitely a must try! The Real Orient Mahjong - Date Pancakes with white chocolate and Matcha ice cream was little sweeter for my palate. And Hot Chocolate Cookie over fudge is completely a chocolate delight.Overall had an amazing experience, special thanks to Mr Kuldeep and Mr Pratham for brilliant hospitality!

A 3 course meal with butterfly pea tea which is an innovative way to drink tea, has colour changing properties on adding lemon.The menu is as follows:Drinks:-Yaki LimeFresh Lime SodaThe drinks, or known as Elixirs by the restaurant were kind a of dissapointment, the Yaki Lime was a burnt lemon concoction but lacked the basic seasonings.Opting for mocktails with your food would be a better choice.Starters:-Crunchy Corn KernelsSichuan Chilli Pepper ChickenGolden Fried PrawnsChicken and Onion Sui MaiThe starters kicked off with a great start, the pepper chicken was adequately spicy and was cooked really well, the prawns were a delight for any seafood lover, Tiger prawns cooked to perfection, the coating had correct consistency and was not at all oily.Main Course:-Stir Fried chinese greens with minced garlicCrisp river sole fish with Oyster sauce and seasonal greensGong Bao chicken with Dry chilli, Peanut Sugar and VinegarShredded lamb with caspsicum, onion and CuminJasmine RiceHome Style NoodlesSince all of us were non-veg enthusiasts, we opted for most of the non-veg dishes, The chicken being the best dish out of them, the sauce and the peanut combination elevated the dish.The sole fish and lamb needs a little improvement in terms of consistency of the sauce and also the cook of the meat, a little more tender lamb would taste a lot better.Desserts:-Passion coconut lime shortcakeDate pan cake with ginger ice-creamHot chocolate cookie over fudge sundaeThese were the day-savers, the desserts were just outstanding...!! They were hand crafted minutes ago and served to us, the ginger ice-cream is really innovative, gives you the needed sweetness and the perfect hint of ginger at the same time. The crisp pan cake just suited really well with the ice-cream.When you visit Mahjong, you should be expecting a full blown chinese menu, the service is very apt and the staff is knowledgable enough to help you select dishes, its a new place in the city and definitely deserves a trip for chinese lovers....!!",40204152, 4.0,                                                                    276

With the pub culture and themed restaurants dominating Bangalore, it's definitely a pleasure to find a proper fine dining with a tasteful decor. And the most appealing part is the soft background music.We began our course with the butterfly blue tea,which is a Chinese Tea with lemongrass and mint infused flavour. Add a dash of lemon and Voila! The blue tea changes colour into violet. This is not just refreshing but also acts as a great palate cleanser between dishes.Amongst the starters , I really liked the Crisp Lotus Stem with Sesame.If you like your food a little sweet, you are sure to love this one.The Golden Fried Prawns was also impressive and did not feel too dunked in oil as it usually looks at most other places.Coming to the main course, the Gong Bao Chicken , Crisp River Sole and shredded lamb made a perfect combination when paired with the Lotus leaf wrapped Jasmine rice. Ditch your favourite noodles and fried rice for once to pair up your Chinese dishes with Jasmine Rice. And you will sure be delighted that you tried! If you are ordering the shredded lamb with Capsicum ,onion and cumin, be prepared to witness an overpowering taste of cumin ,but it gets balanced when combined with Jasmine rice.The deserts were a delight to both my sweet tooth and the eyes! Each and every desert came with a spectacular presentation. If you love chocolatey - then Hot Chocolate Cookie Over Fudge Sundae is just for you! And for those who like it Fruity- you will love the Passion coconut lime shortcake. And the punch in the deserts is that you can even add a dash of your favourite liquor to your sundae.To top it all .... a 5 star standard service by the efficient crew made the dining experience in Mahjong even more worth.Ambience : 4.5Food : 5Service: 5",40170784, 5.0,                                                                    46

It‚Äôs on the main road, very easily accessible. Coming to the brews I tried : 1. Cider : MUST TRY for those who like the milder beers. A very juicy flavour and a sweet aftertaste! 2. Stout: Their strongest beer but not that strong as compared to other stouts (I liked this fact). It has a flavour of coffee and a vanilla based smell to it. 3. Hefeweizen: Tasted like a genuine German wheat beer and it had a tinge of banana essence. 4. IPA5. SaisonAll the whiskey based cocktails were delightful to have but one can avoid the cocktail Metallica. In food i tried: 1. Anda Bhurji Pao (MUST TRY) 2. Dimsums3. Appam (MUST TRY)4. Oakwood smoked tandoori malai broccoli (MUST TRY for the experience and taste)5. Pizzas were excellent6. White sauce pasta was good too! Their buffet system has a lot of variety and is pocket friendly too if you see the variety and the quality! The desserts, you must try the Malai toast, the mango panna cotta and zauk e shahi!

Well, we did went to get some nice cozy evening to enjoy Bollywood night. Hospitality: 4/5 - the staff is quite courteous and helpful. Though the place was overbooked and crowded, they still did pretty good job.Food: 3/5 - the vegetarian food is bit of a disappointment here especially if you have set your expectations with Byg Brewesky or Hoot in the surroundings. I would really encourage to work on the taste of your dishes.Ambience: 3/5 - the place is quite small and gets congested after a while. One big worrisome thing was that they do not have a designated smoking room/area, which makes people like me who is non smoker to sit outside and enjoy the pleasant evening.Overall: 3/5 - this place has potential to step up if they really want to.

The Daal was mind-blowing.¬† Perfect Dhaba style.¬† Buddha Delight was good...a tad too bland for my palate.¬† ¬†Tried two desserts, of which the Torta de Tres Leches was insane.¬† Probably one of the best desserts I've had (other than my obsession with Baked Cheesecakes).¬† The taste and texture complimented perfectly and I couldn't help go back for more bites.¬† Zauk e Shahi - is the currently trending Jamun with Rabdi and it's not something I would ever like.¬† Too sweet and too rich.DJ Tosh was brilliant with his mixes, old and new.¬† It was obvious he knew his audience.¬†¬†This place is all things great.¬† Again, fantastic layout and huge!¬† Must visit!                                            foodloverspark.com",40324408, 4.0,                                                                    136

With loads of seating options both indoors and outside, the multi-levelled arrangement makes the place quite lively on the weekends.BeveragesFor cocktails we had the Black Diva, LIIT, BullFrog, Cranky Jude, Chocoholic and House on Fire along with the Beer Flight.The Black Diva was a wonderful concoction of Jack Daniels and Coke along with a hint of ginger and lime cordial, begging you for seconds. The LIIT, Bullfrog and the Cranky Jude are boozy goodness that all assure to get you smashed by the end of the meal, and though slightly on the bitter side, are good pairs with bar bites. The Chocoholic is more like a milkshake and offers you chocolate liquor and coffee rich Baileys and should be your go to if you are not too keen on getting wrecked. The House On Fire provides a fun way of getting Gin shots in your system, with the bartender lighting them on fire, providing you with the perfect Snapchat story. Finally the Beer here may not be as strong as the other breweries, but if we had to recommend one it would be the IPA.AppetisersIn the vegetarian options, we had the Jalapeno Poppers, Ranch Mac and Cheese, Chilli Mushroom and The Rig Spl Veg Nachos. For the Non-Vegetarian we had the Brandy Chicken Tikka, Bang Bang Chicken and the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings.The Chilli Mushroom was undoubtedly the highlight of the veg appetizers as they were seasoned well and had just the right amount of crunch which was something we absolutely loved. The Rig Spl Nachos was also quite good with a healthy amount of toppings which went great with some Crispy Nachos. Both the Jalapeno Poppers and the Mac & Cheese were a bit bland for our liking so its probably not something we would recommend.The Brandy Chicken Tikka is a hearty and gritty starter that with satiate your hunger right through the door and have you craving more, a must have. The Bang Bang Chicken was a Peri Peri flavoured Popcorn sized Chicken which would be a great snack with any of the Beers you decide on. Finally the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings were a slight let down, and lacked the acidity and bite that you would normally expect out of such a dish.Main CourseFor main course we had Sails Burry Mushroom Burger and the Farmers Pizza along with the non-vegetarian MeetZaa.The Burger was a delight to the eyes when it arrived and we had high expectations for this one. The Patty was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside which is just how we like our burgers. The non-vegetarian MeetZaa was unfortunately a let-down, not only in terms of the cheese and texture but also the garnish, which was lacking in terms of flavour.DessertsOur final indulgence of the day was the Baked Apple Pie with Ice Cream and the Triple-Chocolate Cheese Cake.Coming to the end of our meal, the Baked Apple Pie was a huge hit, with the perfect balance of tart and sweet, sporting a well-balanced crumble and a Crust that was baked to perfection. We also enjoyed the Triple-Chocolate Cheese Cake which was not as gritty as a New York style cream cheese cake, but was more on airy and light, with the right amount of chocolate to help in rise above an ordinary cheese cake.Overall VerdictThough we did see a few misses across the entire meal, we do recommend at least one tour of the place based on their great service and lively vibe, along with a good range of dishes for everyone. This would make for a great brunch location considering how much this place has to offer.Food: 4/5Price: 4/5Ambience: 4.5/5Service: 4/5",40296131, 4.0,                                                                    118

Loved the Lolipop, though I did not like the noodles much. In beverages we took beer and Cosmopolitan. The cosmopolitan was quite hard. It tasted more like SEX ON THE BEACH.Staff/ Service: So I had a major issue in this aspect. I had booked a table for 9.30pm through Zomato app. A confirmed reservation to be clear. I reached there around 9.32pm. The lady at the reception checked the same and told us to wait. After a while she told us to go to the first floor. When we reached first floor the man on the gate told us there is no table available. I told him I have a confirmed reservation for which he stated that Zomato is giving confirmed reservation without the notice of the resturant and they do not take reservation after 8.30pm. This was a big turning off for me. After a bit he did let us inside and another lady escorted us to a table. Rather we got 3 table options. So my point is if the tables were available, why was that man uselessly wasting our time?? And why was our reservation denied??Other than this the service staff was again very polite but very slow in service.

Not a long time ago, the residents and employees working in the area had far and few choices to explore and would mostly be left with no choice but to travel farther to Koramangla & Indiranagar to get-together and outings. Heard about the recent entree of 'The Rig' into the night life scenes of Sarjapur Road, and was very keen and excited to explore it. Finally got a change to visit the place with my graduation friends who were on work-related travel to the Bangalore city. With a little selfish interest of exploring ""The Rig', chose to spend the evening there. 'The Rig' is located at a stone throw distance from Wipro on the Sarjapur Main Road and is certainly at the best location as far as the competitor microbreweries in this area are concerned. The facade of the building looks magnificent and the pathway that leads you to the dining / bar area is wide and beautiful. The passage leads you to a huge bar and an even spacious & bigger hall on the 1st floor - with a variety of sitting options to choose from. The table / chair seating arrangement on the floor, the bar stools at an elevated sitting area that leads through a staircase and outside (smoking-friendly sitting area) that overlooks the entrance - a lot of options to suit your celebration occasion and mood. We sat comfortably on one of the tables in the hall facing the bar and began our 'The Rig' expedition.  We tried the In-House Brews - Siason, Hefeweizen & IPA. Personally loved the Saison, which was a little fruity and spicy with a nice citrus peppery finish. IPA was also worth trying, which is a traditional British beer, though a little bitter than the Siason & Hefeweizen. The food options weren't too elaborate as in the competitor microbreweries in the area, still a refreshing change.  A good place to hangout with friends, worth a try.

Never thought Paneer could taste that lip smacking (cuz I'm a chicken lover). ""Chilly Mushroom"" was tasty too. ""Kung Pao Chicken"" was good. ""Mangolian chicken"" was cooked with mushrooms. It was too good and I had never ate anything like it.Mocktails were colourful and presented fancily. ""Crimson Lake"" was purple and tasted like sprite and blueberry. ""The Yardbird"" was an orange based drink with its chunks. ""Very berry Cranberry"" was a mix of apple juice and cranberry juice. It was nice but a lil sweet. Now alcohol is a scam here. Over priced to the heights and really not worth it. They also offer 5 types of beer samplers- cider, stout, ipa, hefeweizan and Saison. Stout was the most unique with coffee infusion(I loved it).

For Ambiance 5/5.Food :4/5 I really liked Teriyaki chicken.They have their own crafted beer I did not like there cider beer it was horrible but apart from that I really like IPA . I even felt scout beer was little bit hard in terms of coffee taste I felt like it's was not properly blended with the beer. My overall experience was fantastic . Given a chance I would definitely visit this place one again.Although it's a new place .THE RIG is definitely a must go place.

Located right after Wipro gate, a hug red sign with the name Rig is hard to miss.Ambience- As soon you enter, one first sees the bar counter with a few tables and not so lively. A staircase leads you to the first floor that has a wall full of colorful posters and frames of singers. Ambience and seating is modern with tastefully done interiors, also has different seating areas and options including indoors and outdoors. It's a huge place and one doesn't get tired if they observed the ambience and this is a huge plus point for this place.Food- Being a beer lover, I usually pick microbreweries to try out the different beers they offer. Ordered Hefeweizen, Saison and IPA; the beers were good. Once would pickup on the fruity notes and hint of spices. Starters were just Peri Peri Prawns and crispy corn. The prawns were good but the corn was ok, it was served cold to us. Although we did complain about this, the next batch was just a little warm. Do try their Farmer's pizza as it comes with lettuce, I know a little different from the usual ones but delish. Since We had stopped just for a few drinks, we didn't eat much.Service- Service is good and lots of staff to attend to your orders. We had made a reservation and ended up sitting on the second floor which was a little dull compared to the first floor where all the fun happens.A good place for residents of Sarjapur and the IT people who work around this area.

Located just beside the Wipro Corporate office, this place was a little far from where I stay, but looking at the ratings, we thought of exploring this. My personal opinion was that the seating is a little congested. They could do away with few tables, so that people could dance easily. Brewed beer was quite nice and the food was really good. I specially liked their pizzas.Music could be much much better. Disappointed with the choice of songs that were played before the dj jumped into Bollywood. Also, I had expected that the service would be slow on a Friday night, but the staff kept on forgetting our orders. Getting a glass of water was the biggest challenge. And to top it all, they added an extra beer in the bill, for which we really had to argue.I would give a thumbs up for their food and drinks , but service and music needs an improvement soon.

I'd ordered Balle Balle pizza and Margarita pizza along with their beers. The Balle Balle pizza was too spicy. Their stout beer is okayish as it is sweet instead of sour. Tried their cider too, which tasted like orange juice. If you like sweet beer then it's a good place.

They particularly made sure that we were all comfortable and paid utmost attention to our orders and requirement. Infact one of my colleagues had an issue with climbing stairs due to an operation, and the staff went out of their way and helped us get a better seating in spite of a jampacked crowd on a weekend.The place is quite big with outdoor and indoor seating spread across 2 floors and has a fantastic eclectic decor pleasing to the senses. The music was great and the DJ was playing really peppy numbers. The place has a good parking space which is a plus. The place is very popular so getting a table without prior reservation could be difficult.We ordered the chef special Jamaican jerk chicken wings which was amazing in taste! We loved the cajun spicy potato wedges and rig eyes chicken finger. The Brandy chicken was brilliant with succulent chicken pieces marinated in spices and brandy which made the dish stand out! The Amritsari fish, pepper pork, grilled broccoli and asparagus were good too. We also liked the hyderabi chicken and mutton Biryani and it was lipsmacking!We tried the freshly brewed beers and they were brilliant! I would definitely recommend you to ask for the option of ordering small sample of all beers (paid sampling available in the bar menu) first to decide on the kinda beer that suits your taste as it really helped us order the kinda beer each one of us wanted. We also ordered LIIT, whiskey sour and a few mocktails which were well made.Starting from entry, parking, seating, food, drinks, ambience, Zomato gold experience to service everything was great and we had a lovely evening.Final verdict: If you are looking for a good brewery on Sarjapur road with good music, ambience, food, drinks and service, do check this place out!Ambience- *****Food - *****Drinks -*****Value for money - ****Staff behaviour- *****                                        ",39500225, 5.0,                                                                    38

We visited yesterday evening.The entrance is appealing. It has a total of three floors. The ground floor was completely empty.Though they claim to have outdoor seating but there are very few tables placed outside. The outdoor area is very narrow. On the 2nd floor, there are tables for big groups where we were seated since we were 9 ppl. We requested for an outdoor table but they couldn't occupy us. Most of the seats outside were for two ppl. Good for dates not for groups.Their third floor is liitle desserted and less happening.For starters we ordered tandoori chicken, roasted prawns , tawa fish fry, daulat ki chat, jalapeno poppers and paneer chilli.I loved the tawa fish fry ended up ordering twice.The daulat ki chat was another hidden gem. It was a preparation of sweet corn and corn flakes. Goes great with drinks.For drinks we ordered sangria, lake cinnamon, chocolate coffee, mohito and liit. Special mention to sangria. They even gave us a liit complementary.For main course we had dal makhni, mutton curry, butter chicken , pizza , plain rice and tandoori rotis.Special mention to their butter chicken and mutton curry.They even had some salsa performances which was really awesome.They also house a dance floor but the dj was little dissappointing. He played at intermittent intervals mostly it was pausing.Service needs quite some improvement and their outdoor seating as well. Some tables for large groups should be put outside.

It is probably one of most beautifully done up places in Bangalore, three floors on sheer awesomeness. Upper deck is where the real action happens and is the location for the Sunday Brunch.One of the most value for money brunches I have come across, the package includes a superb spread of food and lots of drinks. We started with the beer tasters, they basically have 5 varieties on the tap (CIDER, STOUT, IPA, HEFEWEIZEN & SAISON) with Hefeweizen being my favourite among them. They also had some amazing cocktails on offer of which my pick was Gorilla Milk, this is drink made out of dark rum topped with some milk and chocolate sauce. It was delicious and quite potent. Coming to the food, they have live counters for the starters which can be also be requested on the table from the servers. They had dimsums, a barbeque counter which had Chicken Kebabs & Seekh Kebabs, a pizza counter and a grill for the chicken wings.Chicken dimsums were pretty different from the regular ones since it was all meat and no covering to them, they were just covered with a few bits of rice giving it a nice texture.Among the kebabs, I liked the Chicken barra kebab a tad bit more than the Seekh since it was well cooked, juicy and charred to perfection.Chicken wings were grilled in barbeque sauce and done well. Pizza was probably the show stopper here, perfect thin crust, chicken tikka topping and loads of cheese and chilly. Adding to this, they also had a counter with varied items such as different types of cheese, hummus pita, sushi, salads etc.Overall the experience was great. It‚Äôs a perfect place for a fun filled Sunday.                                          ...Read full post on assortedpages.wordpress.com",39330208, 4.0,                                                                    49 Posts

It is 4 floors of sheer awesomeness. We were here on a Sunday afternoon for the newly started Sunday Brunch. Sunday brunch here at The Rig is probably the most value for money at 995++ for an amazing spread of food and unlimited beers/cocktails.We started with the Beer Tasters, they have 5 types on the tap at all times and my favorite among them was undoubtedly the Hefeweizen which is the Traditional German Wheat Beer. Among the cocktails we really liked Gorilla's Milk which is a dark rum based cocktail.¬†They have live counters for all the food.For starters we had Chicken Seekh Kebab, Chicken Wings, Bharra Kebab & Dimsums, the Bharra Kebab was probably the most awesome among them.¬†Woodfired pizza was fresh and tasting amazing proabably a little spicy but that added to the taste.After having so many starters, we were quite full for the Mains but wanted to try some of them. Stuck to the Mutton Biryani which was a Calcutta Style less spicy with the occasional ""Aloo"". It was very flavourful and a welcome change from the Hyderabad Biryani we are mostly use to.Desserts is something they can genuinely work on since the spread was very limited and some how the general expectation was much more variety. It was pretty basic where I only tried the Rassogula and it was nice.Another aspect worth mentioning is the live music, they had a amazing band playing thru the afternoon.¬†Overall it was fun afternoon, will be going back for more.

I told that my company won‚Äôt refund a scribbled bill & that they should give me a new bill. They straight away refused to print a new updated bill. The manager ‚ÄòRoshan‚Äô came forward along with the attendant & started forcing us to pay on the scribbled bill itself. While we told them upfront that we won‚Äôt pay, the bill was divided in 3 parts hence they asked me to pay the other 2 bills by card & last one on cash. I didn‚Äôt have that and told we don‚Äôt have cash! Here comes the third & final offer from their manager.

A Sunday brunch with drinks in an all inclusive package of 999? There couldn't be a better deal than this.First things first. The price of the Bunch is probably the least among the many other brunch offers in Bangalore. It includes their craft beers, cocktails, IMFL liquor and mocktails along with a huge spread of food. The food included chicken kebabs, mutton sheekh kebab and jamaican chicken wings along with some vegetarian options. There were dimsums in veg and non veg options and a chaat counter. The chicken kebab lacked a bit of juiciness but the others were good. The chicken dimsums were very good. There was sushi but I didn't try them because they were only vegetarian ones. The main course had Kolkata style biryani along with a lot of the other normal options. I liked the biryani and the Kolkata chicken curry. The paneer preparation was pretty amazing too. In desserts I felt there could have been a little more variation.Coming to the drinks, their Hefe is really good. I felt it would need a little more time for the others to mature as they are very new. I didn't like the Cider and the IPA. The stout too could be better. But the cocktails were pretty amazing. It kind of compensates the beer tastes. Having said that, I firmly believe that it takes about 6 months to 1 year for a brewery to mature and get the right combination that suits the pallets of the customers.Overall, I think its a great place for the Sunday Brunch.

I'm sharing my words for this ""A must go weekend hub"" in Bangalore! üòçI decided to try their Sunday brunch event held on the 16th of this month. The lavish buffet that was put up in the post did justice. As my cab parked right in front of the restaurant, I was stunned to see the wonderful exterior it has got. It doesn't look like a restaurant at all. It has got a sophisticated classy outlook, made from brown garden tiles with black walls. As the red and black board highlights the name ""The Rig"", their tagline , ""Where work is beership"" is really captivating. üòÑ As I walked towards the inside, huge glassed walls welcomed me and the receptionist tied a VIP pass. One step into the restaurant and felt like I was amidst the well known singers of all times. This is because, picture frames of all the reputed singers from national to international areas, like Usha uttappa, Rihanna, Beyonce, Michael Jackson and so many others can be spotted. You can dine among these photos and beautiful lights with a central bar counter. It's truly an amazing sight!! üòçüòçüòç As I moved to the first floor, the walls are graffitied with Bob Marley and other rockstars of that time. A huge door opens to an equally mesmerizing view of the interior of the restaurant. The entire place looks lively, filled with wooden chairs and tables. These tables face a bar counter and on the top, the place where live music happens. Two singers sang mellifluously and we couldn't stop from swaying and tapping our feet to our favorite English music! üòáüòá They were amazing and sang their heart outs to entertain us all through the event! The live music area is backgrounded with house like decorations. I heard that they have DJ nights as well! So the party freaks, you will definitely love this place!The food menu contained Japanese, Korean, American, Italian, and Indian food. There were barbeques of paneer, chicken, fish, shrimps, served with roasted veggies. There were wood fried pizzas, pastas and omelette live counters. There were sushis, different types of bread and cheese, wine, cakes and buns. There was a live Chaat counter as well from the Indian cuisine. There were Korean curries, rice daal, noodles, biriyani, Indian spiced up curries and roti n naan. There were dimsums and desserts on the next floor. The dessert section was set up very nicely. The most catchy one was the chocolate tower which makes anyone to mouth-water. üòãüòãüòã They have their own brewing machines and are well known for the craft beer. I tried a cocktail called gorilla milk. It's white rum based chocolate milkshake combo! And it was amazing.. first time ever have I tasted such a drink! The food was delicious and tasting so many cuisines at one place felt great. The pasta had a bit more salt and the daal was quite bland. There was a rajma salad in which the rajma was not boiled properly. I request the management to make a note of these. The staff were very courteous and amiable. Mr. Neeraj was excellent and served all the way with a warm smile. Overall, I had an amazing experience at Rig. üíùA whole lot of delectable international cuisines, great music sung by the best of singers, way too good ambience, high spirited ambience, an active crowd, friendly staff, freshly crafted beer, isn't that just enough to make your weekend to be rightly spent! üòçüòÅ In love with this place and highly recommend everyone to visit this restaurant!

Started our dining with...Basil and tomato soup - it was different in taste and very deliciousSaimiam salad - it was the best I opted for the evening. So filling and tasty.Peri French fries - crispy and nicely tossedVeg noodles - finally a great Chinese dish after a long time.Philly cheese sandwich - it was ok okPav bhaji - I never expected such a great taste. It was just perfect.Baked Apple pie with vanilla - a perfect choice for dessertIn cocktails do try chocoholic and I m sure you all will love it. We were served by laxman for the evening and he was great throughout our dining experience. He was aware of dishes which helped us in concluding. RIG gave me a complete experience of a restaurant from great food to music, from service to customer satisfaction. I would love to explore other options and I am happy I came across this restaurant.

The ambience is pretty good, it's really well done. There was supposed to be a videotheque there, and so we chose this place to celebrate our friend's birthday. But to our dissapointment, the videotheque had been cancelled. Also, we asked to play the happy birthday song , which they usually play at any random cafe also, but the manager said that they didn't have the happy birthday song . This was a huge dissapointment as without the song you can't really celebrate a birthday. Now coming to the food , in drinks, we ordered bira, breezer and one of their in-house drinks. It's a brewery , their in-house drink was pretty good. In food, we had chicken lollipop and crispy chilli baby corn, both of which were very average. We had baked mac and cheese , which was below average. There was no taste. Then we had the chicken tandoori delight pizza, which was very good. The chicken tandoori delight pizza was the only good thing we had there. All in all, the ambience was good , but what is the use of they don't have a basic happy birthday song, and can't make someone's day special. Also, food is very average.

They took 30 plus mins to get the alcohol to the table.Wish they work more on the service and effectiveness of the staff.Another issue I have of the place is the dearth of a real dance floor.

To my surprise the Hyderabadi biriyani here is one of the best biriyani around in Bangalore which has the actual taste and essence of Hyderabadi biriyani.Pulled pork & cheese empanadas:This is a patty filled with pork stuffing served with a dip. This is good but very filling. So if you are planning to try various other kind of dishes think twice before ordering this dish.Chipotle grilled Prawns ( **must try**)Ah what a dish! Those prawns coated with herbs and spices are just too good to give a boost to the taste bud.Chilli pork( **must try**)A plate of love was served in the name of chilli pork. The chilli pork is one of the best chilli porks which I have had in recent time, with the right amount of mixture and texture. The cooking perfect which makes the pork melt in your mouth without making it too crispy.Mutton Hyderabadi biriyani (**MUST MUST TRY**)If you're a biriyani lover then don't miss the biriyani here.

We never had to call them specially or request several times, they were exceptionally good at service.Coming to food and drinks. We orderd crafted beers first. I liked their Cider beer. A friend of mine orderd kaluha which was served on crushed ice, really good. Lastly we had classic taquila shots.And for food we had starters mostly. I had one of the best peanut cashew masala chakna here. Teriyaki chicken was good. Cheese poppers and nachos too.And not to forget the DJ, enjoyed and danced to the bollywood mixes.

The food was alright but nothing to remember by and the service was rather clueless. The staff were running around like headless chicken complete unaware of their own menu.

Vodka lovers do try the Just Rushin and Big Boy Besil, Whiskey lovers go for Lullby and Fasters Horses. Lullby is my favorite its a blend of whiskey, orange juice and Saffron, every drop was refreshing and amazing in taste.Rig not only has good drinks but also great food. Their homemade Nachos are too good, testimony being the number of times we ordered it :) Do order the Rig Special Nachos when you are there.Also tried their thin crust pizza the ""Green Wave Pizza"" - Broccoli, Olives, Capsicum and loads of cheese, it was good in taste.

I am writing this review live. As in while I am at this place. First hassle with seating. I booked through Zomato and hence they refused to give me a seat in the smoking zone cause I didn‚Äôt specify. I reminded them that I booked through zomato and the app doesn‚Äôt ask for preference but to avail. Second, we were seated for 10 minute and still no sign of a waiter bringing over a menu or checking on us. We decided to browse the menu on zomato since we are hella hungry. It took three different people including two senior personnel to get our order right. Now we wait for food. Well at least the food doesn‚Äôt suck. We ordered lasooni dhaniya murg and crispy chilly pork. In both the protein is cooked well. Succulent and tender. We also ordered a beer flight but were informed that they have only three brews available. So my friend ordered Saison and I ordered an IPA. The beer is passable. Nothing extraordinary. We were asked by someone in the management if we neeeded anything and we asked for the menu and that was given to us 15 minutes later. We have now ordered food round 2. Let‚Äôs see. So food has arrived. Service time pretty decent. Another chicken from the bhatti and a mushroom dish. My friend doesn‚Äôt eat anything marine so that‚Äôs a shame. This round is okayish. Nothing outstanding. The brandy chicken tikka has a bitter aftertaste. I am not sure if that‚Äôs to be expected. The ambience is nothing to write home about. Very loud music has been playing all through making it difficult to talk. I don‚Äôt know where the dance floors are but I guess people just get up and dance at their seats.  What ticked me off is on a relatively non crowded night their service leaves a lot to be desired. I am not sure if I will be coming back. Hoot and Byg Brewski are just few hundred meters away with a much better ambience and service and I am assured of tables and great service there.

Live DJ counter adds to oomph to this place.¬†We had couple of Cocktails and Mocktails with samplers of their crafted beers. Big Boy Besil,  it's a vodka and cranberry based drink presented in a bulb container over crushed ice. Very unique. Lullaby, a whisky based cocktail with saffron flakes on top. This was liked by all in our group. Chocolate Coffin was a good Mocktail. Very Berry Cranberry tasted good as well. Strawberry beer was the favourite among 6 of the crafted beers in our group. We had couple of shooters out of which Brian Hemorrhage was visually and taste wise outstanding.¬†The Rig special Nachos were delicious with abundant cheese topping for perfect flavour. My friends loved their Brandy chicken as well as Chicken Lollypop. Peri Peri Prawns were the favourite among the non veg group. They served us Green Wave (Veggie) pizza and a Pepperoni pizza. Thin crust, apt flavours cheese loaded. Delicious Vegetarian pizza. My friends liked the pepperoni pizza as well. I had Green Asparagus and Spinach risotto, it was indeed very delicious. Herbs, spices and cheese added on to the flavours. Perfectly cooked and wasn't lumpy.¬†Finally moved onto desserts and tried Zauk E Shahi. Gulab Jamuns coated in chocolate sauce and dipped in Rabdi and served. It was very appetising!

Went to this shindig couple of days ago with my friends to have a taste of their fresh brews on tap and get my hands on some finger food and delicious combos.They have six brews on tap. My favourite was definitely the apple cider and stout as I'm a big fan of these. The IPA had different reviews from my friends.Cocktails we tried :Lullaby: This was my absolute favourite from all the cocktails I tried. The smooth taste of whiskey with almond syrup and treads of saffron took this drink to a different level all together.Now coming to the food I loved most of the starters and loved their butter chicken and dal Makhni. Very surprising indeed to have that good dal in a brewery. Here's the variety of food we had.For dessert I had Chocolate gulab jamun.

The seasonal brew which came in strawberry flavour was my favourite. Stout and Wheat are the mild ones whereas IPA is the dark beer brewed here.Coming to the cocktails and mocktails, the mixologist formulates some truly excellent fusion. Big Boy Besil and Lullby became a common favourite in our gang. Very Bery Cranberry from the mocktails is a must try.‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è~Appetizers~Chef Manoj Panigrahy has curated some of the best dishes for the guests and we simply loved it.#Rig Special Nachos - The Nachos served with tortilla chips and veggies, was crispy and yummy. I bet you can't stop at just one or two bites.#Curryleaf Khasta Pakodi - The regular homemade pakodi which is a must try during rainy weather. Since there was no sides along with this, we asked the Chef to provide the green chutney which goes perfect with this item.#Jamaican Jerk Wings - You get 4 full sized wings along with veggies. The wings are fleshy and filling.#Brandy Chicken Tikka - The chicken tikka was scrumptious and the brandy heightened the taste to a whole new level.#Chicken lolypop - This was no doubt the best dish among the starters. Such excellent flavours and tender chicken, we loved it instantly.#Peri Peri Prawns - Amazing presentation and delectable taste. Prawns lovers, make sure not to miss out on this one.#Pizzas - Tried both the Green Wave and Pepperoni Pizza. Both were thin crusted pizza with the right flavours. Although somehow, I loved the veg pizza more.‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è~Main Course~#Butter Chicken Combo - This combo consists of Butter naan, yellow dal and the butter chicken. This really impressed me to the core. The butter chicken was tender and flavoursome with the right balance of sweet and spicy. Naan was soft and the yellow dal was out of the world. I am not sure where in Bangalore I had such yummy dal the last time.#Hyderabadi Murgh Dum Biriyani - Biriyani was again decent but the salan served with it deserves a special mention. The taste of the biriyani can be rightly felt after mixing the salan. Raita was thick and mouth watering.#Chicken Kiev - This came with the stuffed chicken, grilled veggies, potato wedges and green chutney. Chicken was cooked to perfection and was filling.#Green Asparagus and Spinach Risotto - I think it's safe to declare the spinach risotto in Rig as the best risotto in town. Seriously, even after being full, I couldn't stop hogging the risotto here. It was so cheesy and full of flavours. This was definitely the best among the mains. ‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è‚ñ´Ô∏è~Desserts~#Zauk E Shahi - This was the gulab jamun dipped in rabdi.

So when a new place opens up the first thing I do is run there. With a bunch of friends visited the rig for a sunday afternoon lunch. Its right on the sarjapur road very easy to spot. I just loved the place as soon as I walked in felt like a old english pub. There are levels inside where you can sit and the Dj is at the second level so everyone can see him. We sat in a big table as we were a group of 12. The best thing about going in large group is you can taste a lot of different food.We ordered our drinks first, as this is a brewery obviously most of the guys in the group ordered the beers. They have six variants.There was a huge variety of cocktails as well. Which is obviously my favourite..! They cocktails were unique and each one had different taste. The  presentation is also mind blowing. My favourite has to be the Rumble Tumble.Then we started ordering the food. We ordered just to much because the menu itself was so tempting..!!For starters we ordered nachhos( the chips are made inhouse), then Ranch mac & cheese ball (must must must try) , devil‚Äôd egg, jamaican jerk wings (must try), crispy lotus stem, brandy chicken tikka (perfect amount of brandy glazing is done) .There is fresh pizza available,  me being not a pizza fan had only the pepperoni pizza, which tasted nice.One of my friend ordered a burger and by seeying the size I was like wow..!! The burger is average, which is ok as its not a burger joint.I ordered the Pesto chicken breast, which was also nice. The mash potato was perfectly made. The chicken was also cooked and soft.Then came the non veg combo, butter chicken, dal, naan, papad..!! Out of the world. One of the best butter chicken I had in Bangalore. This dish is a must try for mains..!! We had ordered biriyani as well and it was delicious.!!Hard to believe that a brewery had such an amazing spread and such good tasting food.Lastly we ordered a dessert called ‚Äúzauk e Shahi‚Äù, this is a chef special dessert. Gulab jamun coated with chocolate, shahi tukda and rabdi. This was just out of the world tasty. Best thing I put into my mouth. If you go here please do try this.All together I am super happy with this new place, and the DJ plays Desi songs for you to dance away..!!                                            keepitstylishdayita.com",37498082, 5.0,                                                                    257

The Rig is spread capaciously over three floors accommodating a dance floor as well as a lounge space. There is a DJ console in the second floor and projector facilities if one wants to hit the matches on a big screen. They do have an outdoor area as well which is more apt for evening events as it can get quite warm in the day.A few of us were here for lunch on a weekend to sample their delicacies. At present they have a temporary menu displaying the dishes which will be worked on in the near future. We tried a few beverages to begin with and some of the recommended ones are Big Boy Basil (vodka based), Lullby (whisky base) and Chocolate Coffin (chocolate based mocktail). The food was quite an elaborate affair comprising of a selection of appetizers, mains and desserts.¬†-> Ranch Mac n Cheese Balls: An alternative for the customary jalapeno poppers that we get to see on the menu. The cheesy goodness of the macaroni and a deep fried outer layer was a winning dish among the vegetarian lot. In fact it was ordered multiple times around the table.-> The Rig Special Nachos: The tortilla chips used in the nachos are made in-house from scratch but beyond that there wasn‚Äôt anything too special to write home about. But the authentic Mexican elements generally imbibed in this dish were missing such as the cheese sauce and guacamole which made it quite dry.-> Pav Bhaji: As a chef recommended dish I had a lot of expectations from this one. However I have tasted much better ones at the street vendor‚Äôs and it was disappointing to say the least!¬†-> Crispy Lotus Root: Lotus roots tossed in a sweet chilli sauce was a good try. The crunch element is crucial to this dish and it was on point.-> Chicken Liver on Brawn Toast: The cooked chicken liver was blended to a silky mousse consistency and served along with buttered bread toasts which formed the perfect base for this innovative creation.¬†-> Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings: The wings were juicy and well seasoned but an overall uniformity was required to ensure that each one tastes likewise. Beyond that it was a good dish!-> Brandy Chicken Tikka: The brandy taste was subtle and didn‚Äôt overpower the charred flavor of chicken tikka that we love. The chicken was cooked beautifully and a lot of theatre was involved in presenting the entr√©e.-> Crispy Seaweed with Shrimps: The batter used to fry the shrimps was a tad dense thus culminating to its mediocrity. The wasabi dip was more of mayonnaise and lacked the pungent hit of wasabi.-> Deviled Egg Hors D‚Äôoeuvres: Half portioned boiled eggs with a creamy filling of mayonnaise and yolks blended together was a decent finger food option!-> Pizzas: I tried the Pepperoni Plus and Oye Balle variants, the former being a quintessential pork sausage topped pizza while the latter is Indianised by the addition of Paneer Makhani as the base. The pizzas here are worth a try!¬†-> Omg It‚Äôs !!!: A chicken burger which comes with two stacked succulent chicken patties and generous addition of cheese. I had a bite of this and it was delicious.-> Green Asparagus & Spinach Risotto: A good vegetarian main which ticks all the right boxes in terms of flavor composition. However it lacked the cheesiness which ensued in the greens overpowering the essence of the dish. But a good choice for the vegetarians!-> Butter Chicken Combo: The Butter Chicken here blew our mind and I honestly couldn‚Äôt find any faults in this dish. For a bar to set such a high standard for a typical main course item, it‚Äôs truly phenomenal. The butter chicken was accompanied by Butter Naan and a portion of Biriyani rice. Highly recommended for people looking for a balanced Butter Chicken that‚Äôs not overly sweet!-> Hyderabadi Murgh Dum Biriyani: Firstly the presentation was top notch and the boiled eggs on top of the rice resembled a nest like image. The spices were not too hot but mildly flavored and the chicken was cooked to the point where the meat fell apart at the slightest touch.-> Zauk E Shahi: This was the second surprise of the day as it screamed royalty. All the elements in the dish were treated with care and presented in the best way possible. Soft gulab jamoons encased in a tempered chocolate coating and dunked in a sea of rabri was bang on flavorsome.In a nutshell, the Rig is only a few days old and still working towards establishing its presence among trending microbreweries. The place certainly exhibits dynamism in terms of its in-house brewery as well as a happening party destination. The staff is friendly and the service is prompt. The pricing is at par with its other competitors.

It didn't keep up to the level of wheat beer that I have usually found and liked in other breweries.So, I switched to sangria and a whisky sour. Those both were amazing. By far the best whisky sour I've ever had.For the food we ordered a pizza and honey chilly potato. Pizza tasted average but the honey chilly potato tasted delicious.As there was absolutely no crowd the service was quick and the staff was extremely friendly.All in all, I'd rate it a 3.5 for its ambience, great cocktails and good service.

I‚Äôve been here twice, once on a Friday night for some revelry and to watch the football game on the big screen and then again to celebrate the international beer day when they sold a pint of beer for 16 aanas.Ambiance 4.5/5Refreshing to have a new indoor brewery and not have the crowd jostle for position indoors once it starts raining. It's also nice to have clearly demarcated smoking areas unlike some of the neighboring breweries which blatantly flout norms.¬†The space is decently sized. The ground floor is for people who'd stay away from the din of dance music. The top three floors is where the party is. They screen live sports and the large screen has good visibility from the top decks.¬†A small area on the 2nd floor is cordoned off for the DJ and live music. A little clearing morphs into the dance floor once the DJ has everbody tapping to the beats. A lot of bollywoood remix was played by the DJ during our time there. I was also fortunate to witness the 2 piece band which performed some popular classics and alternative rock numbers.¬†From close to the bar or close to the music, a cosy corner or a smoking zone, this place has a variety of seating options and are able to manage large groups with ease. There‚Äôs a lot of pop art on the walls and I especially love the quirky posters on the stairwalls leading to the 1st floor.Food 3.9/5Mushroom Chilly 5/5 Chicken lollipop 4/5Kungpao Chicken 3.5/5Egg pakoda 4/5 Made on our request.

There wasn‚Äôt a hint of any brandy to taste.The menu covers a wide range from bar bites to tandoori starters to chinese starters, continental, indian, chinese and desserts.

It would be nice to have the option of 330 ML as well.Coming to the food, I was quite impressed with it. I ordered a spinach asparagus risotto and it was delightful. The flavors of garlic, cheese and spinach were delicate and well balanced. The rice was cooked perfectly al dente. Plating was pleasant and though it appeared to be insufficient at first, it was pretty dense and rich so that it easily filled up my tummy.The service was good and the staff was attentive.

Also, the menus are articulate enough for each food that you know what you want.In meats, you want to eat the Cowboy Hog. It is an amazing cheese burger that is greasy and when served with crisp fries, does you good. In vegetarian, go for their vegetarian omelette - something made out of a hash brown base (Tip2: Insist that they add salt in the omelette base, else it tastes severely bland. Their proposition is to serve American food, but sans salt, it tastes bad to the Indian pallate, and I know many who aren't too keen on adding salt to cooked food).They serve filter coffee and make it as strong as you want, like really. I order 50% decoction and 50% milk, and they oblige.While waiting, you can open and read through a communal diary that is left at each table. For instance, I once drew a ping saying Oink on a page....cut to 3 weeks later, I see someone sketch a fork and a spoon next to it.Visit this place, it'll be worth your weekend!@Restaurant: If you are reading this, please get that guitar repaired :) I want to play it every time I visit, but the High E Chord is always missing.

Went in here for a weekend breakfast. You might have to bear the waiting time as the place is  densely crowded esp on weekends. But, to counter that the waiting area has been converted into a gaming zone.... where you can pass time playing carrom and foosball.Both indoor and outdoor seating available.FOOD They have all day breakfast menu options.I went ahead with breakfast platter - sunshine on a pan. Pan fried eggs were stuffed with mushroom and greens... absolutely delicious. Served with complimentary fruit juice. We tried watermelon... but found it a bit watery.Also tried the traditional veg. Burger. The potato patty was simple enough but the overall flavour  balanced it. Could have been better.Sandwiches are also worth trying. I tried the veg.club sandwich... lightly grilled and good filling! My non vegetarian friend tried chicken frankenstein and was in praise too! Cold coffee was really yum!Not only this you can try whole lot of options ranging from salads, pancakes and waffles, omelettes,shakes and what not!So to sum up, I found it a great place for breakfast options with an exhilarating ambience.

It was heavenly. The fresh juices and lime sodas are quite refreshing. The waffles and pancakes are mouthwatering too!Staffs are really polite. Even if there is a wait time, they guide you to a nice game room with board games and several novels to help you pass the time. Also, I must say that the food is really really worth the wait!

This item was grilled well and taste was great.Eggstra Curricular Activity with Omelette - In this we selected 3 eggs omelette which was served with beans, mashed potatoes and mushroom. The yellow part of egg was not spread evenly, because of which the omelette taste was average. Beans, mushroom and mashed potatoes were really good in taste.Cheesy Fry - Fries were not crispy because cheese was on top of it itself. If they served cheese separately then it might be good. Because fries were tasty and crispy when we got with other item.Cheesy Chicken - My friend had it. He liked this item.Comp Guava Juice - It was good in taste with right quantity.Cold Coffee - It was totally refreshing and filling. Loved it. One of the best item of them in drinks. Must try.Oreo Milkshake - This is also one of the best item of them. Milkshake with Oreo. Oreo lovers will love it. Must tryMasala Tea - Didn't expected to be good here but this item was good too. Refreshing tea it was.Nutella Milkshake - Average is taste. Don't know exactly but improvement can be made in this item.Bill was Rs 1642 this time including GSTService was not too quick but not damn slow too.At the end while leaving they gifted us small tulsi plant.

We tried -1. Chocolate waffles - topped with banana and served with maple syrup. The waffles were nicely cooked and had the required amount of sweetness - neither too much, nor too less2. The theory of Omlette - It was decent. Just Too many veggies.3. Guava juice - It was very fresh and tasty.4. Filter coffee - Ok-ish. I suggest Better to try their milkshakes, cold coffee, juices as they specialize in that, not hot coffee ...And the best part is they give a Tulsi plant to every customer as a return gift!

Melange of items dressed on a bed of lettuce.Sunshine in a pan is a salad with a twist. Two sunny side ups severed with spinach mushroom and topped with some cheese, with an option to add chicken chunks.As you eke by the food preparation time, you can also unleash your imagination and draw/ write something on a piece of paper that would be there on the table and some pencils.H&N will certainly give you a checklist for all day breakfast junctions.

Firstly, i loved the decor of the place.. the terrace seating is amazing and quite chilling due to the awesome Blore weather. It opens at 9 and gets completely filled by 9.30 so be there on time. Coming to the food, what i loved most are the breakfast platters. Nice to meat you & Sunshine in my pan being my favourite. One can go for the All mighty breakfast & Cant get any pigger too. The sausages are really good. Complimentary fresh fruit juice/tea/coffee is served. Loved the in house papaya jam with the toasts. It is also popular for its burgers, sandwiches & stuffed omlettes. Will definitely try them on my next visit. I personally didnt like the pancakes & waffles much specially the waffles werw quite hard for my liking. Caramelised banana, maple syrup & nutella made good toppings. Full marks for the service & staff. Was handling the crowd brilliantly. Pricing is really reasonable for the quantity served.

The mango macaron was pretty surprising as wellBlueberry Cheesecake- Safest dessert. You can never go wrong with a delicious helping of tangy and sweet blueberry and the ever famous cheesecake.Choco Namelaka with Raspberry and Black Tea- Definitely took forever to try and get the name right. This plated dessert looked fancy and gorgeous, pretty as a picture and some components were great. It had a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste that didn't sit too well with me, but am willing to overlook because of the next dessert!Balloon Brownie- Yayy! Instagram worthy. This dessert is a rich gooey brownie that's covered in a chocolate dome. Hot molten chocolate poured over the dome causes it to crumble and reveal the beauty inside. This was the best of the lot. Definitely gotta try this.The savouries were pretty filling. Their sandwiches are really good and the portions are quite big.There's a lot more on their menu that needs to be tried.Great place, great ambience.For the people with a sweet tooth that can't be tamed, head right over! :)",39986596, 5.0,                                                                    108

Had a couple of deserts and here are my impressions.Ambience is quite good, both indoor and outdoor seating available. The interior is tastefully done , seating is nice and you can buy a wide range of packaged chocolates and other confectioneries in the restaurant itself.Coming to the deserts , they have a quite a selection to choose from, you get cupcakes, whole cakes, slices, macaroons, cheesecakes, ice creams and plated deserts. Plated deserts sounded interesting, where you have a number of components on your desert plate which all complement a central element. We ordered the choco namelaka with raspberry and black tea and a slice of intensive red velvet cake. The plated desert had quite a complex flavour, but not my favourite, it was ok. The intensive red velvet was sinfully good.Value for money is quite good and overall, the deserts here are something you don't find everyday and that itself is good enough reason to try it out. Will definitely be back and try their other menus.

Ambience:The location is firstly splendid since it‚Äôs just off 12 main road and is easy to spot. The overall seating both inside and outside are well optioned in terms of accommodating various sizes of groups. I strongly recommending sitting outside if it isn‚Äôt raining, the overall feel is much better and the AC inside was freezing when we were there. However, ensure you do take a nice walk inside as the displays in Smoor are exceptional.Food:The menu is with all its pictures always makes me want to order everything. However, we ordered 2 dessert. The first was a Honey Nut Crunch Sundae! This dessert was fabulous to say the least! The ice cream, almonds and salted caramel blended so well together. The subtle honey flavour is what made this dish tick so well. The various textures of food added another enjoyable experience. The second dessert we ordered was a Ecuador Hot Choco which was plated extremely well. However it did not live up to its visual appeal. It seemed to have a very similar flavour to a regular dessert and didn‚Äôt seem to live up to the description on the menu. Nonetheless, the experience overall was a good one at Smoor. We did try the cappuccino as well, but I would recommend coming here for the desserts and food. Beverages perhaps in coffee shop may be better. Summary:Great place to try out the sundaes. I have had most of them during prior visits and can say they have all been made extremely well.

We came here after our dinner. Even at 11 pm the place was almost full. We took the table in the deepest corner away from all the hyperactive crowd. We ordered Balloon Brownie, Rasmalai Saffron Entremet and a chamomile tea. The Balloon Brownie lived up to its hype but the Rasmalai was more like a cake and was little low on sweetness. Not what I expected. The tea was also good. It's a nice cozy place with some really good collection of dessert. We didn't get to try much of their food. The price is slightly on the higher side but not too expensive for what you get.Ambiance 5/5Dessert 4/5Price 4/5                                                            ",38886559, 4.0,                                                                    49

That‚Äôs one of my favourite desserts, so I had high hopes when I visited Smoor Indiranagar for a proper meal. For once, I‚Äôll begin with the dessert. I noticed something called Rasmalai Saffron Entremet. Rasmalai is one of the very few Indian sweets I like, so I ordered it without hesitation. And what followed was pure Bliss (pun intended). This dry version was so soft and creamy, with just the right amount of sweetness and Saffron, that you ascend into a different plane when you eat it! Simply superb, a must try here! I ordered Cajun Spiced Fries to start off with, and was quite pleased with the seasoning on the fries. And the main course was the Pizza Vegetariana. The pizza was absolutely loaded with veggies, giving proper justice to the name. The overall food experience here is excellent, and kudos on the lengthy menu for a chocolate lounge. Although I can‚Äôt imagine how the Chinese/Asian food would taste, must try to confirm. But the dessert choice will remain the same, I‚Äôm simply in love! I‚Äôve had their Dark Chocolate cake before, and that deserves full points as well. Coupled with good service & two wheeler parking (limited), it‚Äôs one of the neighbourhood‚Äôs finest eateries.

We had ordered - Blueberry Cheesecake 8 Textures of Chocolate Butterscotch SundaeAll of the desserts were fantastic to taste. The cheesecake was my favourite. The chocolate one, although it tasted good, its name wasn‚Äôt justified absolutely. I could have given a five, deducted points because they served us the wrong bill and charged 300 bucks extra. This is not justified for a place of such stature. Otherwise, this place rocks. Recommended. Happy Dining! :)                                                            ",37284091, 4.0,                                                                    818

Starting from their hot chocolate- luxuriously rich, thick and super creamy, it‚Äôs an entire meal on its own. So filling! The macarons are also delicious, especially the salted caramel, chocolate and vanilla flavours. I happened to go there for breakfast, had their croissant sandwich, poached eggs, fries and the hazelnut hot chocolate. The croissant tasted better plain, without the filling with just some butter. It just didn‚Äôt go with the filling. The filling Was good as a salad but not inside a croissant.

I honestly do not remember the time when I tried their dessert as it was not impressive enough in terms of taste unlike their presentation.So, once I decided to taste their pasta for a second time, the first time being with my girl bestie with whom I ordered the Alfredo pasta which came with spaghetti. It was super delicious and much much better than their desserts if we go without bias comparison. The second time, just two days ago I decided to buy their Alfredo pasta along with buttered almond ravioli. One was better than the other and we couldn't choose either. Both were yummy, very cheesy and soothing great flavour. Loved it and would love to order it again and again.

The aroma of rajma chawal was so alluring that I could not resist it on my plate . The gravy of rajma was thick and spicy . It was the best combo for rice. The gobhi parantha was equally yummy. Finely crushed cauliflowers were well tossed in spices and the paratha filling was superb. Equally all over. With curd the gobhi parantha tatsed as my moms food. Last but not the least I had masala idli. The rava idli well tossed with curry leaves , cumins and red chillies and other spices made it a totally tempting supper for me .

We wanted to choose one of the beautiful pod style seating they have, but were forced by the staff to share the table with some other customer, which was unacceptable.We weren't allowed to select the seating place we wanted, even though the place was almost empty. No staff even cared to take our order either, until we called them multiple times asking if they can take our order. I almost contemplated leaving at this stage, considering the pathetic experience which we had even before we placed our order.Nevertheless we did choose to stay back as we were getting late. As usual, the starters were our focus and we ordered quite a few.The crispy corn chilli pepper was quite well made, and was really delicious. Paneer crackers were really good too. My friend chose the Garlic prawn and loved it.They also have the unique Chicken Sukka Poori, which combines the flavors of a chaat with chicken.The mocktails weren't good at all, the Flying Kiwi, Pinky and The Brain, and My Fair Lady. All were really bad, just sugar syrup with absolutely no hint of any flavor.The Veg Fantasy Pizza was however quite good, so was the paneer biriyani. They also serve a variety of cocktails, and alcohols. True to the theme, sheesha in multiple flavors are also available. They do have 1+1 on Zomato Gold, which is a plus. However, considering just the service alone, I won't recommend this place.Star Factor:Ambience: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê1/2Food: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êService: ‚≠ê1/2Value for Money: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê1/2",39946671, 3.0,                                                                    55

Generally when you order cheesy fries there‚Äôs cheese only on the top, but this dish was filled with cheese, which was amazing. The filling of the chicken sukha puri was delicious. The biryani and the pizza was good but was a little sweet. And the chicken bhel puri had a very different taste. I really liked it. But it was a little salty. And I was disappointed with the melted chips as it tasted very bad.They even offer hookah which I‚Äôd want to try the next time I visit.They also have this fish tank filled with fishes, so you can get a free fish spa.

I mean FRIED RICE and also it came ‚ÄúWITH‚Äù nothing. I mean imagine its a plain dry chicken fried rice. And yes, the rate is more than 300 bucks including 5% GST. So I paid more than 300 bucks just for a FRIED RICE. I mean let alone my expectations, my dinner was destroyed. It was too late to order any new dish or maybe a side dish to eat with this piece of food.I mean maybe while deciding the name they thought of a new name for fried rice just for fun maybe and named is Meshi chicken and as for the description, maybe they searched for an exotic Asian rice description without ever tasting it. Because I am damn sure they are not even aware of what a sticky rice is else they would not have delivered me this in the name of a Japanese cuisine.

Veg order included jumping balls, snow fall nachos, gunter cheese chilli toast and crispy corn. Non veg included hot bird in the nest, mutton pepper fry, penne chicken arabita, penne basil pesto chicken. In addition, we ordered couple of pizzas too. Veg food was good in taste and quality except the crispy corn which wasn't cooked well at all as it was chewy, stiff and somewhat undercooked. The non veg wasn't good at all with the chicken in the hot bird in the nest overcooked and boiled making it too soft. The nest which was Crispy noodles wasnt well fried. The pesto penne pasta chicken was very stiff and the pasta didn't blend with the sauces and veggies.

I got to try the authentic delhi street food dishes which was quite new and it was totally worth it.Their new menu consisted of chaats, bature, parathas, beverages and desserts.Initially in chaats I tried - Dahi Bhalla papadi chaat (Must try)- Pani puri shots- Suke aloo ki chaat - Chole Samosa (Must try)- Paneer bread pakodaChaats tasted authentic and the presentation was good too! In Dahi Bhalla papadi chaat , Dahi was on the sweeter side which i personally find it to be much tastier. Chole was really fresh and delicious with the crisp and loaded samosas. Paneer pakoda was soft and very hot! Goes well with the mint chutneyAlso amritsari lassi with almonds is a must have here which complements well with the spicy chaats.They also have poori that is served with aloo and pumpkin gravies with raitha, kulcha chole - Delhi's famous spicy Chole served with bread Kulcha and pickle along with boiled masala potatoes. These two dishes were also very delicious and a must try In deserts Jalebi Rabdi was outstanding! Crispy hot thin Jalebis with rabdi is the best combo.Experience in Delhi highway was truly amazing and would look forward to visit this place and try their main course as well.

This was one of my friend‚Äôs birthday treat and what a superlative lunch it was‚Ä¶surprisingly a completely vegetarian one!It‚Äôs a chic place with a bit cramped seating. On a Friday, it ended up fully occupied and the space felt bit more cramped.Supposedly Gin and Tonic cocktails are their signature cocktails and my friend who loves Gina and Tonic was excited anticipating her drink - The Gin-tleman‚Äôs Tonic which was Gin, Jasmine Tea, Elderflower & Grape Tonic water served with rose petals and cucumber ice. The cucumber ice that looks like ice crystal formation with the rose petal looks beautiful and it was really good. I had a rum based drink called The Red Indian which was Amrut Two Indies, Clove, Cinnamon and Cherry, topped with champagne and cranberry juice, I loved it. Towards the end of the meal we ordered the British Raj which was Gin, Pomegranate, Cinnamon Tonic Water with Rose Petals and Cucumber ice. This was lovely as well with its blush colour. The drinks have a printed tag at the bottom of the glass to indicate the name of the drink, it is a nice touch.Everything is beautifully presented here, especially loved the food presentation. We started with the Pickled Apricot, Pumpkin Seeds and Smoked Cheese Salad‚Ä¶what a delicious start! It‚Äôs rare I crave a salad I have eaten‚Ä¶this is one of those, with perfect seasoning. We scraped everything off the plates, and stayed one of the staff who tried the move the serving bowl in a hurry to ensure we had cleaned off the few pumpkin seeds that were left on it. I have a new respect for radish after having the spicy radish cake bites here which were scrumptious (and the radish cakes at Yauatcha as well). We were going to try the vegetable kibbeh but opted for the Bajra and Ricotta Gnudi on recommendation and boy oh boy were we happy that we did‚Ä¶the sauce of Amaranth and Spinach, local greens veloute and fried onions with the Gnudi made it a food orgasm for us. This dish is what my British friend would term as nouveau Indian cooking as it has local touches.The pulled young jackfruit tacos were beautiful to look at and disappeared in fraction of seconds as it was yum but it was too little. We ended the meal with the fresh pumpkin gnocchi which was truly out of the world gastronomic experience as we both like pumpkin. This is also a must try dish‚Ä¶if you are vegetarian.. as there are lot many awesome options for non-vegetarians as well. We wanted the taste of the gnocchi to last on our tongues for a little while so we opted out of dessert (and we were full).What can I say? Food that is beautiful to the eye, on the tongue and comfortable in your tummy. I could eat here every day. So it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs not located in Indiranagar. But it WAS an awesome place for a birthday Toast with a Tonic.

Firstly, this place has one of the best ambience in town, we got to sit one floor below ground and it felt like something out of the Prohibition in the US. The walls had the brick showing and the wall hangings just added to the overall ambience. To the desserts, firstly all of them tasted incredible. However it‚Äôs the texture and presentation that made them even better. The variance from softer to crispier textures created an unforgettable experience.

This small place took us by surprise, they have amazing rating on Zomato. Had a little chat with the owners, very down to earth couple, who gave up work to pursue their food dream. They initially had a food truck hence the name blue wagon, now they decided to stay put and opened this place. It is really tiny, miniature seatings, peppy lights adds up to making this place inviting. The lady takes care of the counter and the husband is the main chef with another staff to help him.The food you get here is mainly continental, but they have varieties of our Desi Maggi on the menu. We started off ordering chilli cheese garlic bread, it was freshly made hot and appetizing. Then my kid had a butter garlic mushroom Maggi. Loved this twist and it was an instant hit for my kid. We ordered for 2 Oreo milkshakes, a cheese burger, and a five pepper cheese grilled sandwich. The food was delicious made with precision and had the right amount of seasoning. My better half wanted something spicy hence opted for a habanero chilli cheese Maggi. Spicy lovers I challenge you to go and try this! The hit of the chilli is something one must experience, our mouths were on fire. The watermelon popsicles came to our rescue! The popsicles are a must try, mildly sweetened and extremely delicious. They have seasonal variants too. Another thing I really liked about this place is they recommend healthy options of brown bread and wheat based probably with less or moderate cheese. Kudos to the couple and I wish them a lots of success! People give this place a try!

Been to this restaurant quite recently. We were in Kammanahalli and wanted to try some new restaurant there for lunch. Found this place on Zomato looked pretty good and reviews were great hence made a decision to visit this!¬†Its a quite cozy place, Ambience gives a good vibe of relaxation and the soothing aroma of Asian cuisine just perfectly adds to it. The Steamed Wonton with Wild mushrooms served in Ginger soy broth was what we started with. Wontons were perfect, broth made a great compliment to the wontons and some wild mushrooms gave an elevation to the dish! Just great. Portion was easily good for 2 people.¬†Northern Thai Khao Soi Veg, Curry noodles in coconut milk with Kaffir lime, shallots with touch of cilantro was deliciousness served in a bowl! Flavours were bang on and a must try dish here!¬†Jakarta style Mee Goreng, had some amazing flavour. Indonesian stir fried Noodles were perfectly cooked with sweet soy, some chillies and spring onions and it was good to go!  All the dishes had good portions which serves good for 2.¬†Nothing could have been better than a simple Basil Panna cotta with Zesty orange syrup and some fresh pomegranate right on top. Pomegranate and Orange syrup cuts the sweetness and maintains perfect balance of flavours in each bite.¬†Overall a brilliant place and amazing food!

But, for various reasons, a visit didn't materialise, until last weekend, when we were in the neighbourhood for a movie.OKI can be found at a fairly inconspicuous location in a bustling neighbourhood - just off the main road, on a street full of houses. It has a simple, functional, and charming d√©cor.For all our previous attempts to come here, we arrived on a day when our appetites were not at usual capacity. So, after perusing an interesting and fairly large menu, we decide to mostly stick to starters.We order the Taiwanese Bao (Pork), Chicken Dimsums in Aromatic Sauce, Chicken Rice Paper Rolls, and a Tofu main course dish.The Pork Bao was quite delicious and has been the best I've tasted after the one at Fatty Bao. The meat was soft & well cooked. A lot of other top rated places in Bangalore offer a sorry excuse for a Bao, much less a Pork Bao.The Chicken Dimsums were also good, with the filling being moist and firm, while the dumpling in itself having integrity & not crumbling at first touch. Both the tangy chilly coriander and spicy black beans sauces accompanying the Dimsums, tasted nice, although the former was more to my liking.The Paper Rolls seemed more like a party of fibrous items with cabbage, lettuce and a host of other leafy items, with the chicken reduced to a cameo appearance. It was a decent dish in my opinion. No wow factor.For the vegetarians, all I can say is that the Tofu seemed like a good dish, considering that the plate was clean at the end of the meal. But, no first hand opinion on the dish.We also ordered the Lemon Custard bar with Raspberry coulis & Corn flakes. While the size might be pleasing to those in a quandary after a heavy meal, it will surely disappoint the hard core dessert lovers. Overall, while I found it to be quite a decent choice, I also found the tanginess of the raspberry & the acidity of the lemon to be at odds with each other. Thankfully, it was not an overwhelmingly sweet dish.VFM - Almost ‚Çπ2000, with a few juices/beverages thrown in. Slightly on the higher side considering the location. But based on this one visit, the food seems to make up for that.Verdict - OKI is more than OKAY! I recommend a visit for what seems to be some nice, unpretentious Asian food.

The ravioli served as an awesome precursor to the King of dishes that was to follow. Went on to order the northern Thailand khau suey which happened to be an absolute winner. Mind-blowing splash of Thai flavours of the coconut milk based gravy, seamlessly blending with the noodles and veggies, Khao suey is an absolute must try in this place.

Once inside, the rain started to pour and I was happy to be settled in the cozy restaurant with a quintessential asian undertone.The menu is quite vast, and after browsing through for a few minutes i decided to go for a meal for one.A Korean chicken Bibimbap it was to be.For those who haven't tried it yet, its a bowl of rice topped with a lovely mix of ingredients providing a range of flavours and textures.This particular bowl contained grilled chicken, a fried egg, bell peppers, zucchini, pickled cucumbers, carrots, spinach etc.The dish is to be mixed nicely and can be had as it is, but they do serve a chilli sauce along with it. A hearty and delicious bowl of food, which i didn't even manage to finish.The service was good, and the pricing is certainly not exorbitant.It was a good meal and i'd love to visit again, maybe on a weekend for dinner just to try their sushi menu.

I ended up having a nice time, and enjoyed most of the food we tried out here. Located in the brand new Prestige Shantiniketan Mall in Whitefield, this outlet of Punjab Grill has a lovely ambience. With pictures of the heroes of Punjab on the walls, dim lighting and chandeliers, it has a classy look to it. Now, about the food we tried out here. The Dahi Moongphali De Kebab we started off with was quite okay, with a slightly sweet taste and a grainy taste. The Tandoori Broccoli we had next was good - with a mild tandoori flavour, creamy and cheesy. I loved the Achaari Santra, the mocktail I chose to go with my food, which contained orange juice muddled with Indian pickling spices. Something very unique, but very well done, with the sourness of the orange juice and the spices complementing each other beautifully, neither one flavour overpowering the other. For main course, we tried out the their Pindi Chana, a classic Punjabi dish, and Khumb Makai Tak A Tak, a creamy curry made using mushrooms and corn. The Pindi Chana was very well done, a little high on the sour taste, but it suited me just fine - I loved it to bits. The Khumb Makai Tak A Tak was nice too. We opted for Roomali Roti to go with the sabzis, which was¬† quite good. We also tried out the Tarkari Kesari Biryani, a vegetable biryani dum cooked with saffron. This was very well done, and tasted so very lovely. Mildly spiced but not bland, I enjoyed this dish. We ended our meal with two of their signature desserts - Kashmiri Kesar Aur Gulkand Kheer and Aam Ras Ki Rabdi Aur Churi. I particularly loved the Kashmiri Kesar Aur Gulkand Kheer, with its mild fragrance of roses. The Aam Ras Ki Rabdi Aur Churi was quite good too, but the other dessert charmed me more. The complimentary Paan Shots we were offered post our meal were lovely, and rounded off the evening perfectly. The service staff was warm, courteous and friendly, attentive without hovering over our table. They were helpful with their suggestions, and were well-informed. Prices here are on the higher side. A meal for two would set you back by INR 2000 or so. It was a nice experience, dining here. I would definitely come back here, to sample the other vegetarian dishes on the menu, especially the ones with morel (gucchi).

It has a royal touch to it and the entire place is a treat to the eyes. Punjab grill provides you a complete package of Perfect food, amazing service and beautiful ambiance. We ordered few starters to begin with.Champ Tejdar : Undoubtedly the best Lamb chops in Bangalore. These succulent and flavorful chops are marinated for a long time and cooked to the utmost perfection. Each bite was such a delight. They were juicy and bursting with flavors. Must must try at Punjab Grill.Tandoori Lobster : Lobster chunks marinated in a spice, yogurt, onion and garlic mixture and served in lobster shells.Another must have dish when you visit Punjab Grill. Murgh Malai Tikka : Huge chunks of chicken cooked in a creamy marinade. Great option for those who wan less spiced tikka. The blend of cream-cheese, ginger-garlic and a tinge of cardamom with melt in mouth texture was perfect match.Mutton Boti : Ghee roast mutton served over tiny slices of kulcha. This was little on the spicy side. It was a blend of tangy and spicy flavors and tasted amazingly delicious as well.To pair with starters, I had a mocktail called Dhaniya ka patta which was a different take on the usual Mint mocktails served everywhere. Strong coriander flavour with soda, lemon and jeera was quite refreshing.For the main course, we had Mutton Rara which is Mutton served with keema gravy. The mutton was again cooked perfectly. Paired with Lacha Parantha, this promises you a hearty meal.We also tried Malai Jhinga- Prawns in a cream gravy with a tinge of lemon. A different combination of flavors and a light dish to opt for if you are quite full with the starters. Coming to the exotic dishes that Punjab Grill expertises in, we tried Gucchi Malai curry and Guchhi Pulao. Gucchi are Morels, which are a type of mushrooms that actually contain vast amounts of savoury flavour and are found only in J&k. They totally account for a luxurious dish since they sell at a rate almost at par with Gold. Here at Punjab Grill, these mushrooms are packed with feta cheese and then cooked. It just adds to the existing flavors of the Gucchi.We tried the Gucchi Pulao and malai curry. Gucchi Pulao was served with Cranberry Raita.The meal couldnt have been better. Such amazing dishes.For dessert, we tried Aam Ras ki Rabri. Trust Punjab Grill for playing with flavors and offering you such beauties on the table. It‚Äôs basically a combination of rabri and aam ras arranged beautifully in layers. Presented beautifully, a delight for Mango lovers.Punjab Grill has the tradition of serving Paan shots at the end of the meal which are yummy too.Overall a brilliant experience and special thanks to Mr. Saurav for the amazing service, great suggestions and beautifully executing our experience.                                assortedpages.wordpress.com",40661900, 5.0,                                                                    112

Service was impeccable, special mention to Mr. Sourav Datta for taking great care of us and also his suggestions.¬†We started our meal with Champ Tajdar, Lamp Chops perfectly spice and marinated and cooked to great perfection. Meat was literally falling off the bones.¬†Tandoori Lobster: This was probably the best dish of the night, marinated soft lobster meat cooked in the tandoor along with its shell. Presentation of the dish made it look picture perfect.¬†Murgh Malai Tikka: Very well cooked Malai Tikka, topped with Chandi Warq.¬†We also tried the Mutton Boti, which was done Ghee Roast Syle. Overall the starters were amazing and to die for. One fact worth mentioning here is that all meats are cooked to perfection here.In the Main Course we tried the following-Mutton Rahra: Mutton Cooked in Brown Gravy, paired with Keema. Very Satisfying¬†Guchchi Malai Curry: This is a signature dish at Punjab Grill, it is made with Morel Mushrooms which is one of the most expensive varieties available. Mushrooms are stuffed with Feta & Paneer and cooked in a thick Creamy sauce.¬†We paired the Malai Curry, with the Guchchi Pulao which is also made with the same variety of mushrooms. It tastes divine.

Punjab Grill, on the other hand is fine dining redefined, with their well-crafted take on traditional as well as exotic delicacies.AMBIENCE:Located on the ground floor of the newest mall in Bangalore, Forum Shantiniketan, the place is built in a decent amount of space. The chic ambience screams of the place being an upscale one. The place has both cushioned chairs and couches. It is pretty well lit with some beautiful chandeliers. The left wall is adorned with pictures of some well known people from the Punjab region. There is a demarcated space meant for Buffet section as well. There was a decently good amount of crowd on a Wednesday evening, especially even after being in a new mall.FOOD AND BEVERAGES:I started with Meetha Patta Mocktail, which is one of their signature drinks. The mocktail is their interesting take on regular Mojito with major flavor coming from Paan syrup and Gulkand.For starters, we tried Dahi Moongfali de Kebab, Tandoori Soya Chaap and Assorted Vegetarian Platter. Dahi Kebab were quite crispy on the outside and soft inside. Soya Chaap was well made with the right texture, could have been more spicier though. The Veg platter had Quinoa Methi ki tikki - which was something innovative and tasted absolutely amazing, Paneer tikka multani - was flavorful and aptly soft, Hara bhara kebab could have been less sour in taste, Tandoori Bharwan Aloo laced with honey was something I absolutely loved.For mains, I tried Guchchi Malai Curry, Dal Punjab Grill with Rajgira Paratha and Zaffrani Naan. Guchchi Malai Curry was the highlight of the evening for me. This was a curry made out of Guchchi Mushrooms which are supposedly the costliest mushrooms in the world. The mushrooms were not slimy which was a good thing for me. They tasted really well with the Rajgira Paratha, which is another kind of grain. Dal Punjab Grill was basically Dal Makhani and it tasted really good with proper amount of butter in it. The Zaffrani Naan complimented the dal really well.For desserts, we tried Kashmiri Kesar aur Gulkand ki Kheer, Kulfi Falooda and Aam Ras ki Rabri aur Churi. The Kheer tasted like heaven with Gulkand taking the dessert to another level and it was my most favorite among the three. The Falooda was ordinary, just presented in a Kulfi fashion. Rabri and Churi was my second favorite with subtle sweetness and powdery texture well complimented with Aam Ras Rabri.Also before winding up, they gave Paan Shots to digest everything, which again, was quite innovative.SERVICE AND COSTING:The service at the place was very good and the staff made us feel like at home. Apart from knowing the menu thoroughly, they were really humble too. The price is the only downside at this place. Extravagantly high price for most of the dishes mentioned in the menu. It's a little too costly but the experience does match the price.All in all, a good place to celebrate some occasion in a lavish manner.",40649331, 5.0,                                                                    104

Good service, great place for a reunion with friends or family. Not light on the pocket, btw worth a visit during special Occasions. And to enjoy a good meal once a while too. I personally enjoy both veg and non veg starters, desserts is a must. And not to forget the Mocktails, as the building is new they are yet to get the Liquor license. Very soon there would be cocktails on the menu too.#SpecialInfluencersTable #PunjabGrill #ForumShanthiniketan                                                 ",40558047, 5.0,                                                                    29

When I heard about their new branch in Whitefield, I hardly waited to pay a visit. Being an enjoyer of punjabi food, I paid a visit to indulge in their flavours.Asusual, ambience is quite lavish with courteous staff. They have a decent space which could accommodate approximately 100 folks. Here is what I tasted thereüëâMeeta patta :As the name connotes, this non-alcoholic beverage has a melange of flavours like gulkand, meeta, katta and pan. If you like the taste of pan then definitely it's a must try.üëâSalmon tikka :Norwegian salmon is tandoored with dill, fennel, honey and garnished with some microherbs. It is super tender and tastes delicious.üëâMutton ghee roast :Mutton is cooked to perfection and it has that strong aroma of ghee. Mutton pieces are placed on a handy roti and the combination is utterly delicious.üëâTawa scallop :I always have some space in my tummy for scallops. I would say this is one of the best dishes over here. Scallop is fresh and well-cooked. It has slight citrus taste which matched perfectly with scallop pieces. Do not miss to try this!üëâDahi kebab :The chef succeeded in getting the perfect texture to the kebab. Dahi stuffed in kebab is very fresh and very delicate in nature. I couldn't have asked for a better kebab than this.üëâGuchichi pulav :The speciality of this is truffle mushrooms. It's seldom to get truffle mushrooms. The pulav tasted fragnant and rich in spices. Truffles mushrooms are cooked to perfection and super tender in nature. This is a must try.üëâAam ras ki rabdi :This mango flavoured rabdi is truly a bliss. It is moderately thick in consistency and high on taste.üëâLitchi ki tehri :Another desert which blows your mind with intense flavour. The milk and litchi combination tasted great.Emphatically, my experience with punjab grill is great. Would you like to try their dishes?

Interiors are nicely done and gave a feel of fine dine place. The outlet is not very spacious but still can host around 50 pax. We were seated comfortably on a table of four and ordered the starters and beverages. The coconut and cucumber mocktail (I don't remember the name) literally came in a tender coconut, beautifully decorated and equally refreshing!In starters we started with Mutton Raunakeen Seekhan which was Punjab grill's version of mutton seekh kebab. The marination was perfect and the mutton just melted in mouth. Next came the lamb chops aka ""Champ Tajdar""- One of the finest lamb chops in town. A must must try out here! This was followed by ""Murg ki champein"" which was their version of chicken tikka. Again a great starter and a perfect 10 on ten to it. My friends tried ""Tandoori Lobster"" which looked grandest of all . I do not consume prawns so was at loss! Though four of us were hard core carnivores, we still couldn't resist ordering the famous ""Dahi ke kebaab"" and it outlived our expectations!All the starters were excellent and thus I had very less in the mains. A spoonful of aromatic chicken dum Biryani, a slice of paneer kulcha with daal makhni and butter chicken and a small bite of a multi grain roti with paneer lababdaar is all that I could push through! Main course items were quite decent except for the daal makhni for which I had higher expectations from my previous experience.Even if my tummy is overloaded, I still smile and make room eying the desserts. Kulfi Falooda, Aamras ki rabri and Litchi ki tehri were the threesome that we shared and tasted. The first two were outstanding but the lithi one could have been better.Staff had been greatly helpful to decide on the menu and constantly cater to our needs. Overall I loved the place and would love to visit again :)                                            diaryofmoments.com",40519588, 5.0,                                                                    182

The Orion Outlet Mall was good, but wasn‚Äôt great.  I was a vegetarian when I visited the Orion outlet & I loved the Dahi Kebab & Drinks, Restaurant were good, but not great.  However the non vegetarian I tried in this outlet made me change my impression about this chain & I absolutely loved every dish.I started off with a refreshing Pineapple & Tender Coconut Mojito.  A Refreshing Take On Pina Colada, The Tender Coconut Water Replacing The Coconut Milk Cream, with the added Fizz Of The Mojito, A Must Try here.While we waited for our array of appetisers, we were presented with a Papad Sampler Platter.  Assorted crunchy papads served with delicious array of Tamarind, Mint & Tomato Chutney, absolutely delicious.The Raunaqeen Seekhan was a Melt In Your Mouth Chicken Version that was perfectly seasoned & beautifully cooked to perfection.  That mild smearing Of sauce on top, just was a fabulous idea & just elevated the whole experience.Literally Falling Off The Bone, the Ghee Roast Mutton was beautifully roasted & finished off in a Tandoor.The Murgh Ki Chaampein was Beautifully Marinated Chunks Of Chicken, deliciously presented & tasted amazing.Offcourse we ordered the Dahi Kebabs, that‚Äôs been my favourite from the other outlet as well.  These Are The  Most Wellmade Dahi Kebabs That You Can Find In The City, however the elachi hit could have been toned down a bit in both the outlets.And The Star Of The Show Tandoori Lobster just stole all our hearts.  The presentation was fabulous too.  The Freshness Of The Produce Was Only Enhanced By The Tandoori Style Cooking, absolutely mouthwatering & delicious.  Don‚Äôt you ever miss this for the world.For mains, we had the Multigrain Roti, Garlic Naan, Paneer Kulcha With Dal Makhani, Paneer Labadar & Butter Chicken, Delicious but we were still raving about the starters we didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the deliciousness.A Delicious Bowl Of Goodness, Mutton Biriyani was something I did not expect from a Punjabi Restaurant, to be as well made as it was here.The desserts we choose are the deconstructed Falooda, which was by far a well executed dessert.  The Litchi Ki Tehri could have done a little more with the litchi infusion, which was mild.The Aam Ras Rabdi was delicious, very well made.Overall a great dining experience, Wonderfully curated & beautifully executed, a great place for a family get together or a catch-up with friends, colleagues.",40510309, 5.0,                                                                    280

The place wasn't too crowded as the mall has just opened. The ambience is simple I would say. Nothing extraordinary but still kind of holds a Punjabi feel to it.For starters, we ordered their famous Tandoor Lobster, Raunaqeen Sheekhan, Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill and Chaamp Tajdar along with another of their famous dish, the Dahi kebab. The lobster was so good, it is difficult to describe in words. The presentation, the preparation, everything was out of the world. This is definitely a must try if you are here. So is the Chaamp Tajdar. It was so succulent, the mutton literally fell off the bones. I loved their Raunaqeen Sheekhan too. It was Punjab Grill's take on the classic sheekh kabab. Absolutely wonderful.In the main course, we ordered Paneer lababdar, dal makhni, butter chicken, mutton biryani and an assortment of breads. The paneer lababdar was superb. The paneer was so tender it melted in the mouth. The butter chicken was also very good. Their dal makhni is usually one of the best, but the one we tried, lacked that extraordinary punch given they had set such extraordinary standards. But having said that, it was still good.If you really like Punjabi food, this is the place you shouldn't miss. An absolutely delightful restaurant.

I was delighted to see them open their new branch in the newly opened Forum Shantiniketan Mall in Whitefield. This place is even bigger than their previous branch in Orion Mall. The food and service is excellent as usual, with a grand ambience.Few days back went there along with few of my foodie friend and it was a grand experience. Started of with the Raunaqueen Shekhan, which is Punjab Grill‚Äôs take on Mutton Sheekh Kebab. The kebabs are tender and delicious and made more  juicy and flavourful by being dipped into their signature sauce. The Chaamp Tajdar or the mutton chop are one of the best in the town. Perfectly spiced and tender, falls off from the bones without much effort. The classic Murgh Tikka Punjab Grill is also non-vegetarian starter worth trying. The Dahi ke Kebab is as usual one of my favourite here, despite being a vegetarian dish. The star of the dinner was the Tandoori Lobster, cook to perfection and plated in an elegant way inside a huge lobster shell. The lobster was extremely fresh.The main course dishes matched up the quality of the grills. The Paneer Lababdar, Daal Punjab Grill and Butter Chicken paired up well with the naans, kulchas and rotis we tried. The Paneer Lababdar and Butter Chicken were perfect, but the Daal could have been a little better. The dum style Mutton Biryani was fantastic as well,with perfect balance of spices and flavours along with long grained basmati rice.In the dessert, we tried the Falooda Kufli, Aam Ras ki Rabdi and Litchi ki Tehri. The Falooda Kulfi is excellent, the Aam Ras ki Rabdi was pretty good as well. The Litchi ki Tehri was okayish and lacked the taste of litchi apart from the whole fruit inside.Overall it is an amazing experience and would love to visit again. They even have an awesome lunch buffet on weekdays, which is perfect for team lunches. Though they have limited items in the buffet, but quality is amazing for each dishes and most importantly the main courses in the buffet are of great quality and taste.

Newly opened in Shantiniketan Forum mall in Whitefield, this is surely a new addition to the list of North Indian restaurants this area.Bright lighting and elegant seating and decor marks this place a fine dine experience. Suitable for couples, business dinner/lunch and hang out with friends, this place has everything for everyone.A little costly but this is how they have position themselves and the experience is worth it***************************************************WHAT WE HAD‚û°Ô∏è QUINOA METHI TIKKI - Best in class tikki made out of quinoa grain, high on protiens and well prepared, this is a perfect starter for the vegetarian‚û°Ô∏è BHATTI DE MURG - Well marinated and too tender a chicken, this is surely a must try. Nicely presented, this is surely in my repeat list when I am here.‚û°Ô∏è MUTTON CHOPS - Try it to believe it. This is too tender to believe it a mutton. Well prepared, this is prepared for almost 6 hours and hence this tenderness. Again well marinated, this is a must have dish.‚û°Ô∏è TANDOORI CHAAP - Chaap being a north Indian veg delicacy is hard to find in this part of the country. But this place has nailed it. We'll marinated and again a must have for vegetarians‚û°Ô∏è SALMON TIKKA - The only dish which dint do much justice but surely there are so many others to try‚û°Ô∏è BUTTER CHICKEN - Very authentic and loaded with butter, this is an ideal meal with any type of kulchas or butter naan. Too good to have and again one of the best butter chicken you will get to try here‚û°Ô∏è DAL MAKHANI - Again the best in class Dal makhanis, this is a must try in this place. The way it should be loaded with oodles of butter and perfect taste this goes well with jeera rice and butter naan‚û°Ô∏è GUCHCHI PULAO WITH GUCHCHI MALAI CURRY - The best of the lot. If a hard core non veg can say this, imagine how it would be. Stuffed Morkels in the curry and basmati rice with Morkels in the pulao.‚û°Ô∏è FALOODA KULFI - Dint like it much. Kulfi was good without any doubt but the vermicilli was a bit chewy.‚û°Ô∏è RAS MALAI - Just wow. Perfectly made rasmalai and reminds me of my hometown up north.

Don‚Äôt Let The Mellow Pink Fool You.  This is not Rose Milk or any other sweet drink.  This spiced coconut milk & kokum drink from the Konkan Coast was a wonderful way to cool off those warm Bangalore days.To keep our interest up & interesting we had the Spicy Mumbaiya Misal Pav.  Delicious, Authentic, something as close to what you get in Mumbai, loved every bit & almost slurped the bowl.The Kolhapuri Paneer was delicious, spicy & strong flavours, Paneer was nice & soft, but was too overpowering of salt, which made it quiet unpalatable.But all was forgotten, when the Jhunka Bhakri Thali was served, the Varan Dal was absolutely delicious.  It was by far the best I have had in Bangalore, perfect garlic punch, with julienned ginger pieces, beautiful balanced spices, took me to those wonderful days in Mumbai.I would recommend this place & the Thali just for the dal, a perfect accompaniment to not just the Jowar Roti that I had, but also with the rice.While I was happy with the way the Thali went, going ecstasic, with the dal, the dessert course was served. While the plain shrikhand was good, slightly more sour, what came next was probably the Most Delicious Amrakhand You Can Find In Bangalore.  It was made with fresh mango preserve made from this year‚Äôs produce, absolutely fabulous way to end your great meal.Overall a great experience that was elevated by the Misal Pav, Dal, & the amrakhand, a must visit for your Maharashtrian cravings or simply if you have crazy love for dal.

The restaurant is almost no frills with very simplictic interiors.Food here was quite decent and homely sorts.We were treated with ""Solkadhi"" which for those who dont know is a pink coloured drink with a tadka of spice which is something different than normal refreshments.So we dug into,""Vada Pav"", the Marathi favourite staple food. Must say the vada was very spicy and fresh. I can taste the difference in taste than the chains selling Vada pav.""Misal Pav"" was something I had for the first time and I would say I was quite impressed. The super spiciness of the curry that is served along topped with crunchy namkeen goes very well with the Pav which is served.However in both of cases I would like to say that the pav quality could be better.""Sabudana Khichdi"" was yum and delicious. The use of Ghee was so generous. The raste was fresh and amazing.""Chicken Keema Pav"" was the best thing that I had that day. The keema was very nice and went very well with the pav that was served.""Sabudana Vada"" was also very delicious and nice to have.""Chatpata Mutton Sukka"" was good and spicy but felt chicken pieces could be better marinated and more soft.The thalis are the delicacies here. Choose your thali and one thali is quaint enough to fill your stomach.We ordered ""Salmon Fish Thali"", which would be fish lovers delight. Fish was very fresh however I do not like the smell of Salmon that much. So couldn't really enjoy it much how you can say the preparation was very good and the fish was very fresh.""Fried Mutton thali"" was good as well.The thalis contained two chapatis, tambda rassa which is a tangy gravy. There was a vegetable and one grainy gravy which was mid way between sweet, sour and tangy.Quantity was decent enough for one.However I feel pricing was bit too high for the quantity served.Quality of food, especially the thali was good but not as great enough to justify the very high price. But the flavour of Maharashtra was there which was quite enjoyable.We ended our day with ""Shrikhand"" which was delicious. Not too sweet, not too sour, just perfect.""Puran Poli"" was good with generous amount of Ghee in it.""Amrakhand"" for surprisingly well and we didn't expected to be that good especially during a non mango season.""Kokam Sherbat"" could be better and use of kokam extract could be better.Thanks for the invite from management and wish them well.

Both the mutton dishes were amazing and perfectly cooked to give tenderness to the mutton pieces. The Chatpata Mutton was excellent. We even loved the Crab Sukka.

Being short staffed the owner was taking orders.Food: We started with Misal Pav - It was good, but need to work on its flavorMasala Egg Bhurji - Hands down this was the best Egg Bhurji I ever tasted. I loved it.Sabudana Vada - it was good, I felt still much could be improved on it. I have tasted better onesSabudana Khichadi - this was the best I ever tried. Well cooked and best served hotButterMilk - It was good. Quite refreshingThali - I had Solo Vegetarian Thali - it was simple but best thali I ever tastedIt had Chass, Dal, Amti (Red Dal), Koshimbir, tomato bhaji, papad, chapati, and Jeera Rice.I loved the Amti, and Tomato Bhaji. The Koshimbir was well prepared with perfect salt. I recommend this as well as the Gala Vegetarian Thali. Both are worth trying.In Dessert I had Srikhand and Aam Ras, I loved the Srikhand more than Aam Ras. I felt it was flavorless. Need to work on the Aam Ras.Overall. This place is a worth visiting location. I would love to visit again for the Jhunka Bhakri which I missed this time. And also I want to try Puran Poli.

One pizza serves two, and my favourite is the Bird in hand!They also serve shakes, but don't forget to try the Nutella freakshake. Best pizzas in town, especially when you soak them in olive oil!

The pizza just because we couldn't resist them after we saw one of them being served. They said first impression is last and their pizza definitely made and impactful first impressions. It looked so tempting and delicious that we couldn't stop ourselves from ordering it.We went for 'The Anna' - Wood fried pizza are personally my favorite so I might have a biased review. The sauce was abit tangy but the flavors were delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with loads of toppings.For waffles we went for 'cheeky monkey' - Now can banana, chocolate and waffle go wrong? I doubt that. It was delicious. The waffle was crisp from outside and soft from inside. It had just the right amount of chocolate sauce. It was served with vanilla ice-cream as well.I heard this usually crowded but we got lucky that it wasn't overcrowded and there wasn't any waiting.The service here is prompt and quick.A must visit place for pizza lovers üçï                                        ",40228842, 4.0,                                                                    86

They have probably the Best Pizzas in Bangalore. The pizzas are so authentic in taste.We had 1 cheese garlic bread, 2 pork pizzas and 1 chicken pizza. If you love pork, you must try them because they are awesome. Try their Pepperoni and Bacon Pizzas if you like pork and if you like chicken, try the Popiye chicken pizza.Our meal was finally ended with a dessert that was waffles with chocolate sauce and ice cream. The dessert was another mind blogging dish, just like the pizzas.So, if you are a pizza lover, you must visit this place.

The pizzas are really good, taste authentic and they have a good choice for vegetarian and non vegetarian. The pizzas to try are the 4 cheese(Quattro formaggio) and the mushroom pizza .

Firstly because I thought the place was over priced. Then, I believed this was just another place on church Street serving pizza's. But well well well, when I realized the pizza's were hand made and baked in a wood fired oven? I was like ""Well, let's go!"".The place is small. And that's that. The kitchen is right there. If you trip you'd bang your head on a table or the oven or the counter. But that shouldn't put you off.They make their dough. Their sauce.(the one on the pizza) Don't know about the cheeses though. Definitely should be imported given the fact they use feta and gouda on some of their pizza's.We ordered ""Smokey marzano and Shrooms"" pizza. Both vegetarian. The pizza's arrive quite quick to your table. Service is humble. Only wish they knew more about the ingredients and their sources so they could interact with customers such as myself. The Smokey marzano was delish! Love the olive oil on the sides. I almost finished the bottle. The sun dried tomatoes, the olive oil and the crispy pizza dough - great combination! Of course the hit of garlic! Mamma Mia! But couldn't say the same for the other pizza - the Shrooms pizza didn't appeal our pallet. Very heavy I tell you. The goats cheese made it quite creamy . So if you going as twos just order a pizza and two thick shakes. If you still hungry at the end of eating up all this, then order more! Plus I'm going to stick to the classics. Need some hard convincing to try the heavy ones.The thick shakes are pleasant and loaded with sugar(heavy cheat day types). We had the one with caramel and the one with strawberry flavour in it.The downs are the sauces. If they made their sauces in-house it'd be more appealing. The ketchup, hot sauce - Tabasco.Price point - Pizza's? I wouldn't complain about the pricing at all. If you'd order an industry made pizza such as Domino's/Pizza hut etc. You'd end paying the same or probably more. Instead you'd have the satisfaction of having eaten a handmade - wood fire baked pizza using local market bought ingredients(some necessary international ingredients). But the thick shakes on the other hand are expensive. Could do justice by bringing the price down(Not the quality).Overall, a place to rejoice pizza's along with your partner, bae, bff, or any random person. They got decent music on. Hands down the best pizza place in Namma Bengaluru.Parking available for two wheelers with a 'Pay & Park' option right adjacent to Brik Oven. Cars? Well, ya know it's church Street. Why bring a car?Recommend? I already did!PS - All pizza's are large!

However, in last one year I think taste of their pizzas have gone down a bit. Some of their pizzas taste really good like 'the anna'. But I didn't like 'the white funghi' as much. I love their shakes though, they are still amazing. My favorite is Nutella mini freak shake which comes in a Nutella jar. As far as ambience is concerned, it is good. Place is little small so you may have to wait before getting a table.

But I wasn‚Äôt at all! This place really lives up to the hype. Didn't take too many pictures though because as soon as the pizzas arrived, if you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat! Thankfully we didn‚Äôt have to wait for a table yesterday at lunch, but the place is quite cozy and you can count the number of tables on your fingers. So it maybe a wait but it‚Äôs totally worth it. It's an open kitchen with one of those big rustic ovens, so the pizzas are prepared right before your eyes.We started with garlic bread, which was yum along with a blue cheese dip. Their speciality is their olive oil and you simply must add a drizzle to the garlic bread and pizzas. Among pizzas we had ‚Äòthe Anna‚Äô for the vegetarians. Loved the sun dried tomatoes and feta on this one. In fact each slice is loaded with cheese and toppings which just drip off the crust! So it‚Äôs messy to eat but delicious üòã We also had the shrooms with bacon, one of the speciality pizzas which was chicken with basil and another chicken pizza that I can‚Äôt recall. My favourite was the shrooms with bacon. And they don‚Äôt hold back on the bacon like most places do. But the best part - waffles üòç it was a good 25 minute wait but really really worth it. We had the apple and salted caramel one, everything from the texture of the waffle to the apple compote to the salted caramel and even the softie was just too good to be true! We also liked both shakes - the big bang shake and nutty but nice.

It was a thin crust pizza with red peppers, mozzarella and spinach. It was quite delicious. The ingredients complemented each other nicely. None of them overpowering the other.We had the strawbreeze waffle. It looked stunning and it tasted almost like how it looked. With the ice cream, the flavour was a little toned down because the ice cream itself could have been a little better.On the side, was garlic bread with blue cheese. The garlic bread seemed like it had spent a little too much time in the oven and that 'burnt' the flavour.We had to wait for half an hour for our seats, even on a Monday evening, but the pizza was worth it.The open kitchen and the staff add their own charm to this pleasant place.

They have nice ambiance, cozy atmosphere's and very kind and courteous staff. Due to the lack or space, there's always a wait but TRUST ME the wait is worth it!!So between 4 people we ordered one starter and three pizzas namely;Cheesy Garlic Bread - Really delicious and soft bread, and the cheese is out of this world. Must try!Smokey Marzano - Beautiful pizza, the sundried tomatoes complement the Feta so well and the pizza is just out of this worldMad Cow - Really tender beef which went perfectly with the Caremelized Onions and Jus. Really flavourful and definitely a must try.Quattro Formaggi - Undoubtedly the best pizza at Brik Oven. A lot of pizzerias mess up the proportion of cheese in their Quattro Formaggi's but Brik Oven has nailed it. Loved the fact that the Blue Cheese is evident and does not get covered up by the taste of Mozzarella. Really beautiful pizza.Brik Oven all in all is a really cute place which hands down serves the BEST PIZZA IN BANGALORE in my opinion. Some may feel that the pizzas are too pricey, but for the quality and service they provide the prices are apt. Definitely coming back here to gobble on some more of their pizza!

We can check our spot in the queue with a link sent by them on our number.-Takes 10-15 minutes to get what you ordered.Ambiance:-Very small place(7 tables) for the kind of crowd that they attract. And it is difficult to enter and exit as the place is a little conjusted.-Cleanly maintained, comfortable seating.-Funny framed pictures and potted plants are an attraction.Food:-We ordered a half and half pizza to taste more than 1 variety in a single pizza-> 3 slices of marinara pizza and 3 slices of margherita pizza: While margherita pizza was an absolute delight with cheese burst, marinara one was equally disappointing as we didn't like the taste of sauce. Kudos to the soft dough used to prepare the base.-Garlic bread with cheese: Liked this one, not too filling and was over in no time as we were starving.-Big bang shake: This is the best chocolate milkshake(with nutella, ice cream, whipped cream..etc) I have ever had!¬†filling, luscious and mouth watering good-> It served as the perfect end to our meal:)Must try: Margherita pizza, Big bang shake.Conclusion:-Not a good idea to visit the place during peak hours on holidays and weekends.

I‚Äôm so glad I discovered this place, better late than never. We have been here thrice already and this place gives more reasons every time to go back to. To start with, it‚Äôs a pretty small restaurant that accommodates a hand countable number of tables. So it‚Äôs a given that there is always some waiting time if you plan to go during the rush hours. We have waited for more than half an hour every time. Moving to the food, they offer a good variety of pizzas both vegetarian and nonvegetarian. Pizza bases are freshly made n baked in the brick oven which is on display and tossed mostly with freshly made goat/feta cheese, which is the best part of the pizza -as far as my liking goes :) I have had diavoli, anna, and red cota. All the three were so brilliant that i haven‚Äôt been able to pick my fav. My friends have liked the nonvegetarian version of it equally too except for the pepperoni which was dry and didn't blend as I was told. Another plus is they serve half and half pizzas; probably one of its kind in Bangalore. Apart from pizzas, this place also offers some of the notorious shakes. Nutella mini freak shake and the freak shake are mentionworthy; laced with a generous amount of Nutella and vanilla ice cream and garnished with Ferrero Rocher, KitKat, waffles, and everything amazing. All in all, this one is a heck of restaurant and is a must try if you fancy pizzas with shakes and waffles                                        ",37410131, 5.0,                                                                    47

This is the perfect summary for one of the best meals I‚Äôve had in a long time, and it happened on a lazy Sunday afternoon to make it better! Owing to its small size and popularity, Brik Oven often has people waiting outside for a table, especially between 12:30-3pm. I had a 10 minute wait, after which it was Pizza time! I ordered the Marinara Pizza and the vegetarian Diavola Pizza. I was especially waiting for the former, because I‚Äôve eaten some excellent ‚Äòcheese-less‚Äô pizzas in France and Italy. And when it came, I sank in and it was pure bliss! I love the sauce they used, and all the ingredients perfectly complimented each other. This is definitely the best pizza I‚Äôve had in Bangalore! Then came the Diavola Pizza. With its interesting m√©lange of toppings, it was a completely different experience from the Marinara. Good different, especially the spicy aftertaste giving it the edge. My friend and I rounded off the meal with a cold coffee and a shake. Food wise, this place is absolutely on top. Very reminiscent of hipsterish famous pizzerias in Paris and Florence. The service is quick, but when it‚Äôs crowded, the existing help look like they could use an extra pair of hands. Two pizzas and two drinks (cold coffee and shake) cost 1400 INR including taxes.

They use their own cheese which gives the pizza a distinct taste.A regular visitor of this place. My favourite pizza are - the Beach seafood pizza and the pig. The Sea food pizza has amazing taste. It's just melt in mouth also the flavour will enhance when you will have it with the few drops of olive oil served in the table.The pig will be served with crispy becon on the top . It just gives the heavenly taste.Their all the pizza taste is unique and equally good. A very small place but definitely good food. Keep serving amazing pizzas. My personally favourite place for pizzas.In the shake my favourite is Nutella shake it's great.But getting a table is a pain have to wait a long time for table.Overall had a great experience.

Less space for seating. Food is horrible. The quality of ingredients used is of the lowest grade.The mozzarella cheese used us so bad that even on a piping hot pizza it's hard as a rubber tire. A good quality mozzarella should soften when put in the oven.The tomatoes used were so sour, the pizza was just unbelievably tart. If the right variety of tomatoes are not used then it spoils the whole pizza. Also the tomato sauce was so watery that the cheese on top kept sliding off when the pizza was lifted. This also made the base extremely wet and soggy.The base is made out of locally procured cheap wheat flour. The pizza base gave me a flavor of a badly burnt tandoori roti. It had no characteristics of a pizza base like the sponginess and the colour. The edges were as hard as a rusk.The preparation also needs some fixing, all the pizzas served to customers while I was there were all burned as per my classification of burnt food. I even saw the staff breaking off charred edges of pizzas and garlic breads before serving to the customers.I just hope someone from brick oven just learns the basics of making a good Italian style pizza. YouTube would be a good starting point to understand where you are going wrong.

The masala Omelette, which was served with two slices of toast and a generous dollop of butter was delicious and quite filling. The mushroom cheese sandwich was also quite tasty , but I have had better.

My favorites being the baked cheesecake and the key lime pie. Must definitely make sure to try them out.Overall a really nice place to have some good food or some delectable desserts.

Great achievement for me to finish reading a full book in a caf√©.It was a weekday, and quiet and drizzly. This place is designed like a Kerala two storey home with the quadrangle like the Nalukettu , so you can feel the rain and this makes it charming and nostalgic to me. There is even a traditional kitchen stone grinder left out in the middle of nowhere as a design touch. Nice and rustic feel.  The Kochi Kashi Caf√© is more rustic and blends with the surroundings but a caf√© of this style bang in the middle of Koramangala makes it feel more spectacular. Loved the place!¬†It‚Äôs a place I would love to take my out of country or town friends.

I am motivated to write this review nonetheless, because of the near perfect date I had here. Wanting to whisk away from the busy-ness of Koramangla 5th block, we ended up at DYU (her choice üòÖ) and I am glad we did. The ambience was just perfect to enjoy the cool evening, staring into the starry sky as the night fell. The place literally burgeons from inside a house and hence has a bit of quaintness to it, enhanced by all the artistic excellence that adorns the walls and the measurable collection of books they have! Finally coming to the food, which was a bit of a let down on an otherwise enjoyable Friday evening. Being a coffee fanatic, I ordered the espresso freddo and it was served as expected (check). We then ordered a chicken melt sandwich and some meatballs which were nice, nothing exceptional (un-check). The sandwich, which was served with a side of wafers, had a melt in mouth filling, but wasn‚Äôt grilled (crispy) enough for my liking. Anyway, I shall save my judgement for another day as I believe we did not put their food to a fair trial. Amongst the noisy clubs and pubs of Koramangla, this cafe is a place to have a memorable outing, with its cozy ambience and soft music, while having meaningful conversations and spending quality time with someone.

Loved the banoffie pie and the English breakfast. The sandwiches could use a little help though. One problem, 4 items off the menu should not amount to 2k in the bill.Liked the whole ambience, the staff was very good and alert.All in all, a good place to be with but pls keep in mind your wallet's weight.

It gives you homely feeling and rustic decor to win!They also have some novels. You can just grab one and read there munching some food.This is my favorite place for a lazy day and good old conversations. I loved the seatings with sewing machine! Its so much fun. While they have renovated lately they have another floor of seating too. Its lovely during rainy times to sit here and just enjoy the weather with a cup of hot chocolate or coffee!French toast is my go to order here! I absolutely love the super soft and mouth melting French toast paired with whipped cream.For starters I have tried Fries and cheese balls.French Croquettes is unique and must try starter. It has mixed veggies with peanuts and cheese served with mayo and tomato sauce. They have different kinds of Mayo do ask for it if you are a mayo lover like me!I have tried their fresh Pineapple juice, its refreshing!Their signature Chocolate Cake is killer! Moist spongy cake with rich chocolate sauce is love.The hospitality is the best I have to mention! It hasn't changed over years :) You ask them anything and they are at their toes to serve you! I remember asking them to charge my phone and they were kind enough to charge it with their own charger that too!And all this doesn't make a hole in your pocket but makes you order an extra dessert :PI can't wait to go back and have some peaceful time and of course Chocolate Cakeüòç                                        ",38769210, 5.0,                                                                    103

What a cute pretty place it is. You feel like you are home where you can get some good yummilicios food. This is one of the outstanding cafes of Bangalore. The ambiance of this place is simple yet rich. There is amazing collection of books. If you are looking for some alone time go here, take a book from their little library, order some nice coffee and spend some time. Everything seems just alright after doing this. I cannot get over this place.     Friendly waiters. Good service. Love the crowd. Ordered hot chocolate coffee, chicken winglets(honey glazed), chicken steak. Being a coffee addict, I have to tell you that this is the best coffee I have ever had. Taste of food was beyond expectations. Steak was made of chicken stuffed with spinach and served with some cooked vegetables and fresh cream. Spinach never tasted this good before. Ordered tender coconut pudding for dessert and I am still drooling over the taste of it. The smell of it, the texture, that smoothness, and the way it just melted like that is way beyond words.

I've been here earlier but this time around I ordered from Dyu art cafe. Tried almost all the pies they have to offer. Key lime had the tanginess of citrus complemented well with the curd base creamy dessert. Chocolate pie had a nice flavor to it as well. I would have liked the Banoffee pie more had the toffee flavor been a bit strong. Banana overshadowed any other taste in this one. But all the pies had a good buttery crumb base to it. Salted chocolate caramel tart is a good option for the chocolate lovers as this is sweeter than all the other options I tried. Chocolate ganache was made quite nice but the caramel in it was very sweet. Overall it is a value for money option.                                                            ,38456727, 4.0,                                                                    75

We ordered the chocolate cake because it was on recommended and I just found it too sweet. Fish fingers and onion rings were good too. Now, the thing is the sandwich was basically just bell peppers and couldn‚Äôt taste any other veggies. Same with the pizza, so much of capsicum on a Mexican pizza is a huge turn off. The pasta was cooked well, but it felt more like pink sauce than red sauce. Cold chocolate was average. The cheeseburger really was just very bland.

After having tried several dishes during various visits, this one time, I decided to finally post a review. I tried a few sandwiches, while the portion seems to be quite good, the sandwiches are quite dry and they don't have enough cheese in them, thus the flavour remains quite bland. Moving on to the pasta, the sauce wasn't creamy enough and there wasn't much of it in the dish, however, the pasta was cooked to perfection, so this was a half attempt. The cheese balls were delicious; perfectly crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. And to top it off, the cold chocolate was as perfect as usual, though the chocolate cake could have been slightly more moist, as it felt thick and the ganache was cloudy. On the whole, this was a little bit of a miss, and it was quite surprising as DYU has had better moments.

Loved them both.Next we tried the chicken schnitzel, it was good, crispy but it felt like it was more of cutlet-y dish than a schnitzel. We also tried the Quattro formagio pizza, now this is Seriously loaded with cheese and I personally loved it, if you're a cheese lover, do try! They also had some cherry tomatoes on it to cut through the richness.For dessert we tried their signature chocolate cake, key lime pie and baked cheesecake.The key lime pie was the best out of everything we had today, 5/5. The chef's signature is extremely decadent and very rich, perfect for chocolate lovers. The baked cheesecake was a bit of a let down, it was kinda grainy, not the best but definitely wasn't bad.Can't wait to visit again! Huge thumbs up!

I had ordered a sprouts salad, cold chocolate, spaghetti and a mushroom cheddar balls.I crave for mushroom and honestly over here I did not kinda like it with the cheddar cheese balls as it was too much of a calorie when it is deep fried and cheesy at the same hand. So I would say not a great dish but not bad either. Once in a while if you are having a cheat meal then go to kinda dish it is!!Cold chocolate- another version of cold coffee with some amazing chocolate syrup and cream. Love love loved it!!Spaghetti - I am a big fan of spaghetti, but here It was very bland is what I felt along with olives and zucchini.

I picked this place because of the great rating of Zomato. It is nothing even close to average, not mentioning more than that. The place is nice and cosy but neglected - tables were sticky and dirty with empty plates even though guests left. We watched waiters and in general they we more busy talking than taking care of the restaurant. Same proved after we placed the order as they came back to us after 5 minutes to repeat the order (like really...?). We ordered a breakfast set. Disaster: mashed potatoes tasted like they were made from powder, mushrooms were pickled (sour), sunny side up eggs had an egg white raw and bread was dry and old. Cook forgot the bacon for which we had to ask and it was brought after 15min when we basically finished eating. After that we ordered a chocolate waffle which was good but could not compensate the disappointment already caused.I don't think we'll ever go there again...                                            one90six.com",40074946, 2.0,                                                                    61 Posts

If you're a breakfast person and would wake up early and get out of your house for a worthy breakfast, this is the place to be. After much hype, I went there a couple of times. I had a mixed experience.For one, you need to be patient because almost always, there's a queue. Average waiting time is around 20-30 mins. Two, if you are a pure veg person, and don't even eat eggs, there isn't much for you there. If you want a relatively hassle free eating experience, go to the first floor. The ground floor is always crowded.What I liked :The veg burgerCheesy friesSanta waffleWhat else I tried :Veggie 9 yards hashThe Santa waffle is a must try. It has white chocolate on top and even while describing it, I've started to have a craving for it. It's soft and melts in your mouth. Some of the best waffles out there definitely. The burger is a safe option for vegetarians. Veggie 9 yards hash is a little harsh on your throat as sometimes it almost feels like they've sprinkled chilli powder on top of roasted potatoes and vegetables.Overall ratings:¬†Music : 4/5Ambiance : 3.5/5Food : 4/5Service : 3.5/5Presentation : 4/5                                        ",39965611, 4.0,                                                                    82

It's not difficult to fall in love with the place, the instant u step in. What I liked the most about the place is the cosy feel one gets here. Good food, decent price, intelligent mix of the old and the new for interiors- the old mosaic flooring constantly reminds us of the house that it once used to be, a neat book shelf, Lennon and pink Floyd, and quick courteous service. It just checks every such box that makes something not just good but very much so. While the menu is slightly biased towards a clientele that has English/European taste, it does offer pretty decent vegetarian course as well. But honestly I feel one needs to be an eggitarian atleast to enjoy the food here. Of the many things we ordered, for the three of us, chocolate pancakes was easily the best.

Ya head out to this uber cool cafe that's literally like a hole in the wall but has cemented a permanent Hall of fame amongst Bangalore foodies . However the waiting period admittedly is the single most worrying crack in an otherwise hefty dam.In here folks give up all pretense of eating and reach out for a lazed out brunch. Lazed out, idleness down to the last bone and a slothfulness almost as if they would settle down here forever and for people waiting in queue it ennervates every moment with intriguing restlessness for tables to turn.This cafe is not simply a happy, vivacious eating joint. It's a house, a home, a refuge that perhaps shored up many states of mind. If you're lucky to get a place inside, it's impossible to miss the wall mounted enormous book stack which perhaps enriched many by its benison of stories. The rooms speak in desirable versions of it's owner and to keep alive the important, evanescent sides of them.Old houses as they say don't belong to people ever, not really, people belong to them. Just then maybe i saw a lady at the counter who to my imaginative self, looked like the daughter, or the grand daughter or the daughter in law who's holding onto this house to disallow it to dilapidation. She's the one who got me my chocolate waffle, nachos and the phenomenal ham ham Burger. As I polished my plate I said to myself it's not for nothing that people give this place a precious one hour's wait time on a valuable Saturday or Sunday.On my way out, I could see packed Ubers dropping off huge gangs of youngsters into this Hole in the Wall.A cafe which possesses a character, a personality and an oeuvre of its own that is both rare and precious in a metropolitan life of shunting from one eatery to another hip joint over the weekends.

They are open from 7.30 in the morning till 3 in the afternoon, and then 5.30-8.30 in the evening. Efforts put in for the interiors of the cafe are much visible and worth appreciating. A book library at one corner, multiple framed pictures across and a pool table adds to it. Staff is courteous, polite and helpful. Food quality and taste are the main forces behind such a high rating of the cafe.

Valet parking is not available but there is a very cheerful and happy securitywala uncle available for assisted parking service.AMBIENCE (4/5): The place offers a very cosy and homelike feel. The interior decor pays homage to the 80's rock culture especially Pink Floyd. One can find quirky wall hangings all over the place. There are three types of seating arrangements available - open air, sofas and near a bookshelf wall. Yes! They have a wide collection of books stacked up for all those bookworms who want to pass some quality time reading their favorite books while their order gets ready. The only thing I feel can improve, is the availability of a proper handwash facility. The handwash sink is positioned inside the toilet. It is a small washroom and can cause much inconvenience (increased waiting time) in peak hours.FOOD (4/5): Ordered Meaty Chicken Cheese Burger with Bacon(Pork) and Fried Egg, The James Brown hot dog with BBQ sauce coated Onion Rings, Ferrero Rocher Waffle along with filter Coffee and Choco Milk Shake. The burger and hot dog were served along with some complementary chips. All the items were lip-smacking good, especially the waffle which was extremely soft and melting over the tongue.SERVICE (4/5): The service was swift and the staff was courteous and attentive.PRICE (4/5): It definitely did not cause any hole in my wallet. The price is quite pocket-friendly.I am surely giving a visit again, this time for the weekend brunch!Happy Binging! üòä                                        ",37275298, 4.0,                                                                    44

I have been visiting the Hole in the wall cafe ever since the time I have been in Bangalore. When it comes to a good old sunday brunch this is the first choice that strikes my mind.I have had a lot of dishes from here but i will be writing only about my recent experience. So coming to the food part, all i had was their classic English breakfast and like always it was top of its class. I even had a lime mint cooler for drink. And for a suggestion part try out their pulled pork french fries. Its like the best fries dish ever!So overall i recommend this place to all especially for brunch lovers.

We asked them to top it off with shredded chicken and the smooth broccoli almondy broth was amazing! Instantly fell in love with it! We ordered 1 and made it by 2. The portion was just perfect for the two of us! Then we ordered batata harra with Herb Crust chicken. These were mashed potatoes and it is a baked preparation. It was okayish. The potatoes were much more in quantity compared to the chicken. We ordered Ethiopian chicken breast. It came with chicken breast and wheat pancakes and some onion sambhal. The sambhal was a bit hard on the nose but the combo was perfect . And ordered Green Detox which was a combination of spinach,cucumber n lemon to go along with it! The detox was just perfect! Exactly what we had been looking for!Lastly for dessert we ordered frozen yogurt bark which was disappointing! It tasted like normal yogurt with raspberries and wasn't that great! The manager was very prompt n courteous and he immediately took the dessert off the bill! Overall a perfect place! The service is very prompt and perfect!

Tip : Cappuccino & latt√© never consist of any water. It's just steamed milk & coffee. Good luck ahead.

Loved the quaint ambience with cool wall art and posters. 5/5The service was prompt and good 5/5We ordered Chocolate Strawberry Avocado smoothie and Honey Supreme smoothie for drinks. Both were yummy though the Honey Supreme was slightly better because of the lovely cinnamon flavor. For food, we ordered Chia wheat rolls with Cajun chicken filling and Sweet Frittata. The chia wheat rolls was the clear winner. 6 rolls with amazing salsa dip, we devoured it in 5 mins. The sweet frittata was basically regular frittata with sweet potato inside. It was tasty but could have done with a hot dip to add some flavor.Ordered the flourless Chocolate cake for dessert and it was delicious and the presentation was eye catching. The cake was placed on mango syrup which added a sweet flavor to the cake.The pricing was decent too. Under 1200 for the  fabulous 5 (items).All in all a great experience and definitely going again and again.

Beautifully warm crisp toasted bread with some fresh avocado with perfectly cooked garlic prawns and all of it coated with melted cheese. Every bite was a treat to taste buds....Next item was the perfect Easter brunch... Succulently slow braised lamb shanks with with a delectable rosemary red wine jus (we asked extra helping of this) and a trio of mashes which were potato, carrot and sweet potato. And a lovely fresh salad was the perfect accompaniment. This was literally gone in 60secs.... N left the three of us totally content with this lovely plate of scrumptious food. The ingredients were top notch, fresh and the farm to table concept at a moderate pricing was the icing on the cake. Even though this was part of their special menu, hoping they add it to atleast a weekly specials menu. Next we attacked the dessert section... A lovely soft cinnamon banana cake topped with a strawberry sauce and some delicious Mango coulis to bring out the flavour fabulously. This was a dream to eat!!! Farm to table concept at it's best at this place. Their philosophy to use organic produce sourced from the farmers directly and serve the customers healthy, sustainable and delicious food at pocket friendly prices is both commendable and unique. Hoping to taste some more of their delectable food.A beautifully light and creamy Avocado Mousse... To round off the beautiful meal we had at this fabulous place we opted for this dish to appease our sweet tooth. A perfectly blended ripe avocado seated on top of a light soft almond cake with a dollop of a dark chocolate sauce on top and all of this rich creamy goodness provided the right hit of acidity thanks to an orange juice and rosemary tea sauce with sweetness provided by redbean paste and pistachio crumbed tidbits. A lovely balanced, less on sweetness and a healthy dessert which leaves craving for more without feeling guilty. The concept of farm to table clearly shines thru with the products used at this place... All fresh ingredients bursting with flavour and perfect for a lazy Sunday morning breakfast or brunch !!! I loved the place so much that I have recommended it to multiple friends of mine, n they have also enjoyed the food here. Post this meal I have been here personally three times and never been disappointed with anything I have eaten here... Recently went there for lunch and it was a perfect catch-up lunch meal... Tea Smoked Salmon... Part of the specials menu.... Beautiful fillets of freshly sourced Indian Salmon which were tea-Smoked with an interesting strong mustard sauce and sauteed bak-choy and to celebrate mangoes... A lovely Mango sambal.... Every bite was a delight and the dish itself became a conversation point... Once again a home runner from this place... Mango season is here.... So why not try the specials.... After a happy staples of mains did a healthy indulgence in dessert... Mango Chia seed pudding.... Beautifully ripe mangoes in fresh coconut milk with Chia seeds and roasted coconuts to give that crunch... A light, refreshing and simply delicious combinations to make a delicious dessert!!!

Flourless chocolate cake - This is an innovation, the chocolate cake was a delightful dessert for everyone, this is a definite must try which every visitor should try.3.

It neither heavy nor lite.Chocolate avocado strawberry smoothie:As the name connotes, it a crush of chocolate, avocado and strawberry. The sweetness in this smoothie is balanced well without adding sugar. If you like smoothies which are low in sugars, then this is a must try.Mexican street:This healthy salad is a combination of lettuce, avocado jalapenos , tomatoes and some raw greens. It tastes so fresh and delicious.Mini wheat chia roll with Cajun Chicken:The wheat rolls are very handy and filled with fresh cheese, sweetcorn and tender chicken and little amount of chia seeds are sprinkled on its top. The rolls are soft and the combination of the cheese and chicken inside it is absolutely delicious.Vegan bodybuilder :This is an organic bowl which comprise of tofu, noodles, garlic, chickpeas , carrots and broccoli. The noodles are well-cooked and tastes little sweet. Unquestionably, its delectable and healthy too.House smoked salmon (Chef special):The salmon is so tender and cooked perfectly with adequate amount of pepper and mustard sauce. It has that strong smoky flavour . It could be improved a bit.TRX Market table force:Its again a nutrient rich bowl which contains greens and vegetables like carrot , broccoli ,potatoes accompanied by brown rice. The brown rice is moderately dry and well-cooked. Taste wise its good but not great, but when you look at its ingredients its absolutely healthy.Squash pie:I have never tried a pie made up of pumpkin before. When I heard it is made up of pumpkin , I sceptically tried it. It tastes little different but definitely recommended.Flourless chocolate cake:An yet more interesting dessert which is delectable in taste. Not too chocolaty and the mango syrup served on that plate is simply delicious.If you would like to detox your body with some delicious organic food, then without a doubt Market table is a wise option .

The chicken rolls tasted much better than the veg, lightly spiced.sweet and spicy market nuts- this was definitely the top pick among the starters. Roasted nuts and raisins with some more stuff, tangy and sour taste which tasted just like a peanut masala served on the StreetSide but a super healthy version of it.>DrinksWe ordered the Beta hydrate, strawberry mango yoghurt, green detox, golden vitality, berry punch. All freshly made and zero sugar.I got myself the green detox which had a hint of cucumber, ginger and lime. Looked nothing less than a magic potion.>Main courseQuinoa Tabbouleh- open sandwich with all super healthy stuff which may seem a lot but was surprisingly light.Keto Tex Mex burger plate - burger without buns, tough to imagine but solid flavor. Lamb patty topped with cheese with a side of lettuce and avocado on a bed of white sauce. Lamb patty was well seasoned and amazing.Omega Caesar with shrimps- Top pick for sure. The presentation itself was fabulous. Shrimps were big and juicy and were probably the best I ever had. All topped with a poached egg with a runny yolk, simply heaven!Vegan Bodybuilder- Again stunning plate of food. Noodles were light and perfect with full of flavors Veggies were fresh and could almost taste the freshness.The Ocean greens- White fish with light seasoning along with the juicy and moist prawns on a bed of brown rice. Rice was fairly good and I was shocked to find that brown rice can taste good.>DessertsSquash pie- not too sweet but decent enough. Never before had squash for a dessert but it‚Äôs a well thought dish.flourless chocolate cake- The best way possible to finish our meal. Sweet, light and soothing with brilliant plating. Eggless and flourless but still held its shape nicely as the Chef explained the use of almond milk in it. Work of art truly!This is a highly recommended place for not just people who like eating healthy but for others as well to try something different for a change.",37766115, 5.0,                                                                    82

Brightly lit, shades of brown and grey dominate the colour scheme of this cosy cafe. It's not too big of a place but the cosy ambience will give you a vibe of a European market. ‚ú®What TummyTumms liked..??‚Ä¢Wooden Plates‚Ä¢Sauces, dips, and bread are all made in-house.‚Ä¢Vegetables are so fresh.

If you want something heavier, the smoothies are a good choice. However, keep in mind that as the fruits are freshly squeezed, you might find it a bit sour (depending on the drink).‚Ä¢Beta Hydrate: Tastes like golgappe ka pani.

It packs a punch and definitely worth ordering again.‚Ä¢MT startup chicken: My absolute favorite. Oven roasted tossed in a sweet honey dijon barbeque sauce. That slight hint of spice makes it a good way to start your meal.‚Ä¢Mini wheat chia rolls (vegetables , Cajun chicken ): Simple starter packed with flavours. It's fresh, crunchy and spicy that you will get over before you know it. I DIDN‚ÄôT like the veg option though.‚Ä¢Sweet & spicy market nuts: Recommended. The exotic nuts is chef's own creation that is spiced with jalapeno, onion and coriander. You can even top it up with grilled cajun chicken.ü•óTime to dig in to real deal: Main Course‚Ä¢Quinoa Tabbouleh: Like a open Sandwich. Tasty and yet very light on stomach.

Market Table in Koramangala is one such place that serves some amazing healthy food that prepared from fresh organic produce. Sugar is not used in any of their items, instead, they use honey or maple syrup if sweetening is needed. Another great thing here is you would be welcomed with a glass of fresh infused water with cucumber, mint and orange - which is extremely refreshing.Among the drinks, we tried the Green Detox, Golden Vitality, and Berry Punch. The Green Detox, which as the name suggest was extremely refreshing and detoxifying drink. Made from cucumber, spinach, lime, fresh mint and maple syrup for sweetening, this drink is a perfect summer drink. The Golden Vitality was good but had a strong turmeric flavour, that many might not like. The Berry Punch, one of their smoothies was made from mixed berries, apple juice, bananas, yoghurt and date syrup. Though was had a lot of flavours in it, but the banana taste seemed to overpower the others a little.Small Markets are the starters here. We tried the following items from the small markets sections:-Batata Harra Prawns - This flavourful starter of baby potatoes and prawns, topped with olive oil and garlic was the perfect way to start the meal.Mini wheat Chia Rolls with Cajun Chicken - Small rolls made out of chia wheat and filled with cajun chicken, this was also a good one.¬†M.T. Startup Chicken - This roasted chicken tossed with barbeque sauce didn't please me much.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Herb Hummus - This was hummus served along with grilled pita bread, probably made out of whole wheat.Ma-Tai Style Chicken - Loved this chicken dish with South East Asian flavours.Mushrooms lettuce cups - These were tofu, mushrooms, Thai basil and cashew nuts served inside fresh lettuce cup. A small bite and lots of flavours burst inside your mouth.Their Salad Section is known as Salad Market. Fresh products directly from the farm to your table. Tried the following:-Quinoa Tabbouleh with Cajun chicken wrap¬†Vegan Cobb saladMexican street meltsAll the salads were good as the ingredients used were fresh and organic.Main Course/Market in a Bowl:Tried the MT Signature Lamb Bowl. Accompanied by rice, peppers, jalape√±os and succulent chunks of marinated lamb the dish was flavourful.Desserts:We tried 3 desserts - Frozen Yoghurt Bark, Squash Pie and Banana Chia Pudding. Loved the Squash Pie among the desserts the most. Squash on a top graham crust accompanied by coconut cream. The presentation was even fantastic. The other desserts were good but nothing great.I would highly recommend Market Table all foodies as well as health conscious people.

Well, how can a place that focuses on health food, with almost every item having an option of Vegan & Gluten-free Options be exciting.  But we were wrong, very wrong.  The food options not only were tasty, but additionally guilt free, healthy & fulfilling.  And that starts with the water, with an infusion of orange, mint & cucumber.  I have had packaged water infusions in the past, but nothing like this fresh off the tower tap, here Market Table We started off with a couple of drinks, and I opted for a Golden Vitality with a slightly strong turmeric flavour along with lemon, carrot, oranges & ginger on a coconut water base.  While I loved it, I must say it‚Äôs an acquired taste and I would recommend the Green Detox instead.  It‚Äôs a beautiful melange of cucumber, baby spinach, mint, ginger, lime, sweetened with maple syrup.To start off our meal we ended up ordering a Batata Harra With Grilled Prawns..  The Perfectly Grilled Prawns on a bed of tiny baby potatoes tossed in Lebanese spices with some roast peppers, garlic, onions, roasted cumin & jalapenos was absolutely mouthwatering, with a wonderful accompaniment.Next came in the Mini Wheat Chia Rolls with Cajun Chicken.  This well made chia rolls from the Small Market selection, were not just tasty but wholesome & very filling.  It was stuffed with a generous portion of cajun chicken, cheese, sweetcorn, on a salad with a sprinkling of jalape√±os. We picked up a Herb Hummus with Pita potion next.  The Perfectly fluffy pillows of pita with those silky smooth hummus infused with herbs is definitely one of the best you can get in Bangalore.MT Startup Chicken was an Oven Roasted Chicken slice Tossed in a heavy sauce with Thai & Indonesian influences, delicious as the rest.The Mai-Tai Style Chicken there we savoured next, was a well marinated & spiced chicken with heavy Thai & Malaysian inspirations, was relatively well made.The Mushroom Lettuce Cups has beautifully cooked mushrooms spiked with nuts, had a nice crunch.  It had to be wrapped in the lettuce cups, folded & savoured like a Paan for that flavour burst in your palate.We ended our starter plates with a portion of a healthy alternative to French fried, Cassava Chips & Salsa Huancaina.  This beautifully cooked cassava chips was an absolute delight especially with the huancaina salsa.Between courses we ended up having a nice little portion of Vegan Cobb Salad, which was a power packed super crunchy and delicious salad, we throughly enjoyed it.We did order in a few mains & shared, the Quinoa Tabbouleh with Cajun Chicken wrap was one of the first that we tried.  This beautiful Cajun spiced chicken loaded wrap with loads of quinoa tabbouleh, veggies & Feta was very full & filling.I loved the Market Table Signature Lamb.  It was a delicious portion of kafta marinated lamb chunks on a bed of herbed rice with nicely roasted bellpeppers, jalapeno, grilled onions, tomatoes with a signature cacciatore sauce.  It was delicious, with the only downside being some portions of a few chunks were not uniformly cooked, nevertheless a top notch dish.After every course we kept wondering if healthy food can taste this good, I can have this everyday.With almost a perfect meal, we weren‚Äôt keen on dessert, but when we were presented with the options, we were curious to try.I absolutely loved the Squash Pie with Coconut Cream.   A decadent slice of squash on a graham crust, naturally sweet did not need any added sweetness, complimented by a thick dollop of delicious coconut cream, absolutely fabulous dessert, beautifully presented & definitely coming back for more of this goodness.The Frozen Yogurt Bark, was a decent dessert, but wasn‚Äôt as impressive as the pie.The Banana Chia Pudding was good too, but nothing as compared to the Pie.It‚Äôs was a great meal & good time spent with friends, absolutely beautiful place serving amazing food.  For me good food should taste delicious first & look good too.  The dishes at market Table ticked off all the boxes & I recommend this place heavily, irrespective of whether you want to eat heathy, or if you are a vegan or need to eat gluten free.

And I don't mean that in a negative way. Not one bit!! In fact, it is a very welcome addition offering healthy and wholesome food without breaking the bank. All of the ingredients they use are natural and they are no harmful additives added to make the dish more palatable. A lot of the items are only pan-fried in olive oil. The place has a very understated ambiance with soft lights and wooden furniture. Even the plates are made of wood. The staff was very courteous and prompt, and this is one place I clearly enjoyed hogging at without the pangs of guilt. We were a group of 5 with 3 vegetarians and 2 non-vegetarians and I am only going to review the vegetarian items that I partook of.To wet our parched throats, we ordered the Peaceful temple, Banana cream pie protein shake, Kula Safi Vice, and Berry Punch. All the drinks only contain natural ingredients (no added sugar) and were refreshing with the right amount of sweetness.To start our meal, we ordered the soup du jour, which was the Broccoli and Almond soup with a slice of whole grain bread. The soup was delicious with the right consistency and the flavor of broccoli was tantalizing.Moving to the starters, we ordered Batata Harra, Mini Veg wheat chia rolls, Tucson Tacos, Ma-Tai style cottage cheese, and herb hummus. All the starters were lip-smacking with a special mention for the Ma-Tai style cottage cheese. This dish is basically chunks of Indian cottage cheese (paneer) marinated and cooked in a Thai style curry. The paneer was soft and cooked to perfection and the flavor of coconut milk and herbs was amazing. The starters had some great accompaniments like guacamole, sour cream, etc. which were also great.For Salad, we tried the Mexican Street Salad Wrap and the wholesome Quinoa Tabbouleh Bowl Salad. Both the dishes were really good and presented well.For the Main Course, we ordered a vegan chickpea omelette, which is basically omelette made of chickpea flour (besan) with a filling of an assortment of vegetables. It was really tasty and healthy too. We also tried the scrumptious TRX Market Table Force Veg with Falafel Patty which was extraordinary.Our tummies were bursting at their seams at this point. But we could not resist the temptation to try a dessert which was the frozen yoghurt. It was tasty and not very overpowering and a fitting end to a scrumptious meal.The portion sizes were generous and did not give us a reason to complain. There is a common saying that healthy food isn't tasty. Market Table proves this wrong and does so in an emphatic way. For all ye health freaks out there, give Market Table a try and you will not regret it. Take my word for it!! Bon Appetite!!Special mention to the chef and Mr. Anthony (manager) and all the staff for taking care of us so well and making our visit a memorable one.

This is place is suitable for everyone, i.e. friends, family and also couples.Food -The food is the best part about this place. Everything i had ordered was excellent and delicious.

In that case, this is just the place to have some guilt-free ones.Food: 4.5/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Service: 4.5/5The USP of this place is 'Healthy Food' and this place very successfully¬†proves that healthy isn't always tasteless. I've been to this place twice already. Once for Dinner and once for breakfast.¬†The time when I went for dinner, it was with a larger group and we ordered a wide range of starters, beverages (juice blends and smoothies) and of course main course. The food they serve has the least oil (if any). The beverages have natural sweeteners (again if any) and the ingredients used are fatless. So pretty much a well-curated healthy menu.¬†Although, what won my heart is their breakfast menu. If you ask me where this place stands in the list of restaurants that serve breakfast, I'll probably say somewhere amongst the best. They have some really innovative, out of the box dishes for their customers and the best part is they do justice to the dish.¬†For instance, a Frittata that I had here was actually baked - this might sound a surprise to you if you actually know that a lot of places instead of baking it cook it in a pan and serve it just because the end product of both of them look pretty much the same.Some people might not have a palate for this kind of food because it's generally low on oils, spices etc and uses natural ingredients, to which the tongue isn't really habitual to anymore. For those, this place is definitely at least a one time visit.¬†Definitely Recommended!¬†Worth a mention, their smoked Salmon is a die for dish! It's a part of their summer fest and is simply orgasmic!

Focusing more on the home-delivery model, they have kept their menu short and sweet. However, they clearly seem to understand what milkshake fanatics crave - thick shakes that are actually thick, delicious, and super filling! I am really impressed by what they have to offer, that too at affordable prices.Our order included the following:‚Ä¢ Ferrero Rocher (Exotic) Shake - 5/5 - The flavour (a blend of FR and Nutella) and thickness certainly warrant appreciation. Take short sips to enjoy the FR flavour to the fullest!‚Ä¢ 'Break'ing Bad (Classic) Shake - 4.5/5 - A thick shake with chewy Kit-Kat bits adding to its density. Loved it!‚Ä¢ Oreo & Red Velvet Milkshake shots - 4.5/5 - Served in shot glasses, this was probably a 'reviewer exclusive'. Gulped these down in seconds!‚Ä¢ Bubble-gum Shake - 4.5/5 - Don't let the plain white colour of the shake deceive you. This one was slightly overwhelming in its bubble-gummy flavour. This by-now-popular flavour will soon be part of their new menu.‚Ä¢ Cranberry Froyo - 5/5 - Excellent! The ideal mix of sour and sweet - the flavour, just the right amount. A must-try!‚Ä¢ Peri Peri Sandwich - 5/5 - This has got to be, hands down, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Complementing the shakes well, these quick bites will surely leave you wanting for more. Paneer, cheese, and chilli - absolute bliss!The hosts were warm, welcoming, and readily accepting constructive feedback. If you're in Jayanagar or live not too far away, give this place a try. I know I'm certainly heading back soon (for the shakes, sandwiches, and the upcoming additions - burgers & fries)!                                arungeorge13.wordpress.com",39941732, 5.0,                                                                    315

The first impression after drinking cranberry shake was - the best shake I've had in Bengaluru.There are a lot of places around Jayanagar for shakes and this stands out to be the best in terms of quality, quantity, price and taste.  All the shakes are priced much lower to their competitors.I ordered a peri peri paneer sandwich, cranberry milkshake, breaking bad shake, spinach and corn sandwich and a brownie bomb.Peri peri paneer sandwich is combination of paneer cubes with peri peri flavoured sauce with a bit of cheese and crispy grilled sandwich.  The quality and the proportion of the toppings were perfect and was delicious.Cranberry milkshake was the best here and probably the best in bangalore too! Was very impressed with the quantity as it can easily fill your stomach with one of these shakes!Spinach and corn sandwich is combination of pasta based sauce with corn toppings in it. It is generally bland and ask for extra spice if you wish to have it spicy.Breakingbad shake It's nothing but kit kat shake with lots of ice cream and chocolate flavor. It tasted really good too.Brownie bomb It's similar to a shot and can be easily gulped at one go if you wish to get the brownie flavor it it.Service is professional  and staff are courteous and will help you choose your options from the menu easily.Would definitely recommend this place!Also it would be great if you add few more food options like Maggi and fries.

So this cafe is started by 2 friends, where the entire execution; right from construction of the cafe to the food menu, these 2 have invested a solid 2-3 months with getting the place where it is :) This, being told when they were preparing my sandwiches!

Paan Wala ( Fusion milkshake ) - This was fresh and had such a Paan feeling with homemade gulkand.2. Red Velvet Cheesecake ( Exotic Milkshake ) - In-home red velvet Cheesecake prepared by them and ugh, it had such a thick consistency! It wasn't too sweet and had such a warm flavor.3. Cranberry Froyo : Fresh - Dried cranberry which is thick and slushy, tasted SO GOOD!4. Peri Peri Sandwich : Mayo and cubes of Paneer, This was my personal favorite and also one of their best seller! ‚ô•Ô∏è5. Corn and Spinach Sandwich : I didn't add cheese to it. They've incorporated white sauce pasta - kinda flavor to it, which I think was a clever move by them than the usual corn & spinach flavor.

My quest for good shakes was on, and here I was!. Since the last few days, I have been ordering shakes at midnight while binge watching Netflix and I have tried a lot of outlets for the same. Hands down, this has been the best till date. When I checked out the menu, the first thing that caught my eye was the Red Velvet Cheese cake shake, and when I got to know that the cake is prepared in-house, I had to try this one out. While the shakes are being prepared, you can play Scrabble.                                                                ...Read full post on littlefoodiegirl.com",38771463, 5.0,                                                                    12 Posts

Loved it too.To light up the thick shakes they serve Mojito as well so we orderedüëâLychee Mojito - This was soo refreshing and tasty. Lychee flavor was really amazing.Few Sandwiches to much along with shakes, we triedüëâPeri Peri Sandwich - This was tasty and had Paneer cubes which were soft and tasty.Froyos which are Yogurt shakes, We orderedüëâ Cranberry Froyo - I would say one of the best Froyo. It was thick and tasty and each sip had a pieces of cranberry in mouth which gave an amazing sour and tangy flavor to the shake.Overall had a great experience and would definitely visit soon to try out more.If you are a fan of Thick shakes then you must visit this place.Ambience - 5/5Food - 5/5Service - 5/5                                         ",38764731, 5.0,                                                                    77

The shakes are very thick and has a real flavour to it by without adding any water or ice cubs in it. If you are a gym freak I will definitely recommend these shakes which acts as a good protein.

That's the way I like it ohhhh yeahhhh.Now from the exotic ranges, I tried the brownie bomb and raspberry cheese cake. The blend in the shake is not soo fine so that you get minute bites of joy of the selective flavor in every sip which is just amazing for the thirst. And have to mention that brownie bomb is a must try.Next had a bite on the cheesy mushroom, spinach n corn sandwich. The sandwiches are pretty pocket friendly with the right amount which is served with wafers. The stuffings were generous and grilled to perfection.The range of frozen yogurts I have the Cranberry fro-yo.The flavor to yogurt ratio was just perfect and just makes the drink quite amazing.Overall - shakes theory have a wide range of shakes to offer with quite high in quantity, immensely rich in quality. The price tags are quite reasonable for the taste and i would definitely recommend everyone to try this place. Great job team Shakestheory.

I fell in love with brownie bomb. I think they should start selling their brownies too. The small pieces of brownies and the crumbly taste with each slurp makes it heavenly.The redvelvet cheese cake was decadent with intense cheese cake flavour. Being a cheese cake lover, it tastes like cheese cake in liquid form, truly delicious. The paan milkshakes was a sweet surprise , cause I was used to having paan only in icecreams, and in a milkshake was a great change. The litchi mojito was refreshing and a great substitute for those who don't like milkshakes.Had a spinach and corn sandwich, which was grilled to perfection, it was crispy and cheesy and very yummy and generous.The prices are very reasonable and college student friendly.

It is very spacious and cosy with the breeze gently blowing in. The staff was also quite courteous. For starters, we ordered vegetable nachos, which were nice while they were hot. But as time went by, it became very soggy and sticky. The baby corn starter was quite nice though. The Pizza Sislain was the dish of the day, delicious and light vegetarian pizza, a must have! Jalapeno Croquets were also tasty, with that extra cheese flavour. In terms of drinks, the white wine sangria was nice, though a little extra fruity, I thought.

Felt like they had mixed the draught and strong together. The after taste was really bad. Also the sad part is that they don't have a pitcher it's either a tower or a glass/ pint.The food part is the absolute main reason why i rated this place so bad. The food is extremely pathetic!Also it's more expensive then the other gillys outlet.What we ordered1) jalapeno cheese balls: cheese pull was a failure.however the taste was yummy (only good part about the day).2 ) beef chilly: extremly confusing flavours and made way too spicy. Beef was cooked well but the masala and Chinese sauces just took over and made this a really terrible dish. 3) prawn ghee roast: first of all this dish took ages to arrive, and when it did it looked black in colour sort of more like a pepper dry.Usually prawn ghee roast is made widely In red masala and sometimes green but a black masala? Ummm so we took a bite the prawn was bland and tasteless. It tasted nothing like ghee roast!We complained to the waiter and he obliged and requested the chef to have a word with us.The chef (I'm not being a racist) wasn't a south Indian and had no idea about this dish. In fact he started an argument saying that this is our bestseller and prawn ghee roast is never red in colour ( massive pause).Google came to rescue when we actually had to show him what a ghee roast looks like and he agreed to changed the dish for us *phew*.The revamped prawn ghee roast was extremely funny(It wasn't evan a ghee roast) the chef added some red chilly paste to the same masala and served it again.We wer extremely angry with the food and realised this place is just good for ambience and night life not a place for a perfect pub and grub!Would not recommend the food here!PS: The revamped prawn tasted so bad that I had to literally waste it and I still ended up paying 500INR for the same.VerdictAmbience: 4/5Taste:2/5VFM:0/5Service : 4.5/5",38384817, 2.0,                                                                    168

Was always curious to try it and finally had the chance to check it out. It's a humongous place with 3 floors. Didn't expect a restobar to be so big and spacious. Inspite of it, the place was jamm packed. After having the food and drinks I realized why!!!The ambience was kind of vintage with carpets and yellow dim lights and all service staffs dressed in red.In cocktails there were the old classics and nothing innovative, the LIT disappointed me. They have to work on improving their cocktails.We ordered the , Gilly's special chicken, which was very well cooked , juicy and perfectly grilled resting on a paratha.For the main course had the red thai curry with plain rice. Oh my god I love thai curry and this exceeded my expectations. Was cooked to perfection and the Kaffir lime leaves flavor and aroma was coming through in each bite.

The terrace as the name suggests is a perfect place for all rooftop place lovers with good music and good food. The service as well was something commendable. Mr.Akash was the one serving us and he made sure we were served with no delay. Mentioning about the food : the Koli Kolar is my personal favourite and I order infact reorder whenever I am at this place. The crispy olive chicken as suggested by Akash was another good starter for all chicken lovers. For the main course the rigatoni Alfredo pasta was just perfect. The biryani was just okay. Even though not expecting a pub to be serving the best of the biryanis. Last but not the least.. the gulab jamun at this place is a treat for my taste buds.. !!

My scores were 4,7,9 (Almost hit the bull‚Äôs eye) in the 3 shots that I tried. With little practice, you may see me in next Olympics.Located on top floor of the building which houses ICICI bank, the place is an easy find. As soon as you enter the place a very comfortable and spacious seating arrangement welcomes you. The transparent glass across all sides give you a blissful view.Food: I tried a variety of Vegetarian items and most of them were beautifully presented and were really lip smacking.Cream of mushroom soup: The classic soup with garlic bread was really a good start. Everyone just loved it and few fell in love with it.-- Chilli Paneer: Perfect Indian flavors, soft juicy paneer and a blend of fresh and colorful garnishing made it a great dish----- Recommended-- Chilli Cheese Toast: Don‚Äôt remember seeing it on the table for 5 seconds after it arrived, it was gone in a wink. The outer cheese covering made it different from other places where it is served. I would have liked a little spicier though. ----- Recommended-- French Fries: Fresh, crispy and Tastier than what is served at most of the places-Recommended-- Cheese Sticks- Crispy Spring rolls with cheese fillings were real yum and looked like as if they were baked.

The Most Delicious Bowl Of Soup I Have Had In Recent Times, such finesse in balance of flavours, it wasn‚Äôt too sour, the right consistency & a much needed basil hit, loved it absolutely, comes highly recommended.The Chinese Behl out here is Super Strong with Chinese Flavours, a strong hit of chilli & sauce with a mild sesame oil aftertaste, it just grew on the palate over time.It was a quick lunch before heading to office, so I humped on to to another classic, an Aglio Olio with a slight twist of Spaghetti.  A Perfectly Cooked Pasta Beautifully Tossed In Garlic, Chilli Flakes & Olive Oil, Made just right, highly recommend this as well.The icing on the top was definitely The Most Delicious Paan Flavoured Panacotta Ever.

Trigereato was how I was reading it but it actually is TrigerEato and has a caption which says meet eat shoot. Yes, you read it right the shooting hear refers to gun shooting. The thinktank i.e the owners when they were planning to set up this place were brainstorming on a lot of ideas on how do we stand out from the crowd and the stiff competition in the locality and that paved the way for TrigerEato which combined shooting range and a rooftop cafe. The shooting range here is used for professional and recreational uses and everyone should experience it at least once it's really a cool thing to try. Not just a shooting range they have a lot of board games with good food and all these things will want you to spend more and more time at this place.My take on food and drinks served: Mock TailsOreo Shake(4/5) - Just the right amount oreo, ice cream and milk blended nicely to give this drink the right sweet levels and it is topped with loads of oreo cookie crumble to give you that nice aftertaste in every sip. I like my shakes to be thick but this was a little less viscous that aside everything was just perfect  Virgin Mojito(4/5) - A classic which can never go wrong and this is one of those items which tells you how good a place is and this place is in the right zone as well. An icy and refreshing drink to lift ur mood Salads - I personally liked the salads more than anything at this place and that's mainly because of the freshness of the ingredients all the vegetables used were super fresh and that made me take more and more portions of these salads and also the healthier side in me liked them a lot more than I personally would. The salads here have a regional touch to them thats what sprates them for me personally from other places Masala Chatpata Corn(4.5/5)  - This is a super hot dish and will leave anyone in tears who does not have a palette for a spicy food. along with corn, this is loaded with a lot of green chillies and that aftertaste will hit you real hard for few seconds and will make you think why did I take a bite for a second and the next second without noticing you will have another spoon. That is the beauty of this dish and this is something which you should not miss if you love spicy food Sprouts Salad (4/5) -  Healthy sprouts served on a lettuce bed with lots of other veggies will surely fulfil your healthy cravings like mentioned earlier the best part is the freshness associated with themHouse Special Caesar Salad Non-Veg(5/5) - I love the bread croutons served in the Caesar salad and that's the first thing I taste in a Caesar salad before I jump into the veggies and meat. The croutons were just impeccable and when combined with the fresh lettuce and chicken which are nicely tossed in caesar dressing it gave me a nice high.Soups Cream Of Mushroom Non-veg(4/5) - This soup had everything that a good creamy soup should have. A very thick creamy texture with loads of chicken is one of my favourites at this place Clear Broth with flavoured Herb Non-Veg (4.5/5) - This looked exactly like a shorba when it arrived and I was little sceptical about trying this since the name and looks didn't match my expectations and I would have regretted very badly If I wouldn't have tasted this dish. This soup is loaded with herbs, veggies, chicken and many more secret ingredients. You should try and experience this dish to get the hang of all the flavours this dish has to cater Appetizers Herb Crusted Bake Fish (3/5) -  The meat was nice and tender. It was nicely done but it was bland towards the end and I felt that flavours were not completely absorbed into the meat and also the topping on the fish was dull on taste. I didn't like it personally Chicken Satay (3.5/5) -  The skewers were nicely done and the way this was presented it looked amazing all the herbs and spices on the top of the meat. I enjoyed the initial taste of the dish all the spices came together and gave it a great flavour but towards the end it became insipid. If the chicken would have soaked in all the flavours then this would have been one of the showstoppers.Chinese Bhel (4/5) - Its this cafe's take on a very famous Mumbai street food. It had a nice spicy and tangy flavour to it and will go very nicely with a wide range of Colberg non-alcoholic beers they serve. This is just that perfect snack which goes really well with any drink BBQ Chicken Wings (4.5/5) - Here it is the star among all the appetizers. Nicely cooked wings are tossed with lots of BBQ sauce will surely make you go heads over heels. I am Chicken wings lover and this dish was made so well that we finished the whole portion in a split second and ordered for one more portionMain Course Mustard Fish Curry with Ghee Rice(4/5) - I was already full but wanted to try this dish as this was one of there best sellers. A nice thick and creamy mustard sauce with nicely marinated well-cooked fish is served with a portion of ghee rice. If you are mustard flavour lover you will surely like this dishDessertsMasala Paan Panna Cotta (5/5) -  Just one word about this dish it's just fantabulous. When u look at it you will be surely confused thinking it is a vanilla ice cream scoop topped with chocolate sauce but surely it is not anything close to it. This dessert is perfectly done and you will taste bits and pieces of paan leaf,gulkand and all of paan's ingredients in this dish This is a nice place to hang out and catch up with friends. Also that this place has a shooting range and also lots of board games surely a group can spend a nice weekend evening at this place snacking on their delicious food.

This is a very unique cafe located in koramangala and is well known for its Air Rifle shooting. I am a pro when it comes to playing games like PUBG & COD, and always believe that I have good aiming skills. Well, this place not only proved me wrong but also taught me that shooting is not just about aiming, there are multiple factors which are to be aligned to get a perfect shot. Coming to the ambience, Cafe is on 5th Floor ( rooftop ), providing a beautiful view of our city. Cozy sitting and open Mocktail bar is also a highlight. I would suggest everyone to tryout shooting first and then grab your meal.

The VFM was poor for this pizza , the sauce wasn't that great but the toppings were lovely. Pizza is a good option for maincourse for 3 people.‚≠êMasala pan panacotta: This was one creative dish I got to witness here , Basically it isn't the panacotta your thinking of , the main ingridients are pan , somp and desi spices , it comes in a steel bowl of cream with these ingridients and the taste is Lovely . If you like Pan , you will absolutely love this dessert.Other dishes I tried :1)Cheese spring rolls : this was quite a bland dish , the spring rolls didn't have any stuffing with just plain cheese.2)Paneer Satay with peanut sauce : The dish wasnt great , it wasn't Satay , more of grilled paneer and peanut sauce wasn't the best of dips .3)Veg grill burger with feta Cheese : There wasn't patty for the burger , the stuffing kept melting when you held the burger , the dish tasted good and had good VFM.

I hear SK Tiffin which is in the vicinity is even marginally better but I am yet to try that. For best results, pay the extra for the ghee. You will be served the khaali dose with sagu and chutney with a huge dollop of ghee so your dosa will be a soft, melt in your mouth deliciousness. It tastes real good even without the ghee. If you are eating the ghee version but also need to try something else like the yummy mini masala dosa or the pulav (both supremely popular items here) then ask for the single khaali dosa, else it is too heavy. The pulav comes in a good quantity and the mini masala dosa which is crispy outside and soft inside is ghee soaked. So it gets too heavy.The place has 2-3 ladies, one at the cash counter and one at the dosa griddle, another for serving. It‚Äôs very nice to see women run the place, but bar the lady who serves the food sometimes along with two boys, the cashier and dosa maker both are grumpy. Make sure you state your order very clearly. The place is popular and can get crowded with families from the neighbourhood, I think especially popular with vegetarians. Every time I have been here, there has been a big turnout of big Marwari families. But the food is tempting and you will be too engrossed to look around.¬†Hygiene is below average and courtesy average. No coffee available, there is decent coffee nearby at a small shop called Indian Coffee Bar. Can have multiple coffees at Rs. 7 a piece to wash down all the ghee.The place is in a small gully, google map takes you to the right location.

It tastes very good because of all the masala which they put in. Then we have the kali dosa which is again served with same combination but here you need to buy extra ghee to unlock the flavours of fluffy dosa. They taste like heaven. Then we have mini masala dosa which is roasted in ghee and have such a brilliant taste on your tongue and it is mouth watering. Here everything revolves around ghee.

Some cool stuff here, if brewers use these smartly.This was a solid excuse to try out their beers. It was a busy evening and I didn't take down notes like I normally do, so these are more recommendations than reviews.In order of beers to try atm,üç∫ Beach Shack - Excellent! It‚Äôs been a long time since we were this impressed by a beer in the city. As the current batch sits, this is a top class session IPA with beautiful citrus and tropical fruit notes in aroma and on the palate with just the right amount of hop bitterness, for this to be a session beer. If you‚Äôre more than a casual beer enthusiast, head here to get a pint before the current batch is gone.üç∫ Grapefruit Lager - Very solid base Vienna lager with classic, rich and toasty malt notes. An extremely subtle sweet and citrusy Grapefruit component adds a very enjoyable variation to what is one of both of our favourite styles of lagers. Wonderfully done! Definitely, get a pint of this, when you stop in for the Beach Shack.üç∫ Rider (American Wheat Ale) - Refreshing! Done like it‚Äôs supposed to be. A nice wheat base carries a very low, hop character that keeps the wheat component in check. Session worthy!üç∫ Phat Abbot Dubbel - Caramel, hints of dried dark fruit esters of raisins and low spicy phenols, but the overall complexity is not as rich as we would like from this style. A very average Dubbel. Worth a try if you‚Äôre already here, but not worth making a trip for.üç∫ Bliss (Hefeweizen) - Good creaminess, great mouthfeel, decent banana and clove component to the beer, but an overpowering lactic sourness made this hard to drink. Didn‚Äôt finish the glass! Maybe, wait for the next batch to order this.üç∫ Phat abbot Tripel - Perfumy fusel alcohols ruin this beer. Any fruitiness/spiciness in the beer is lost in aroma and on the palate in overpowering harsh, undesirable high end alcohol notes that get worse as the beer warms. Possibly served too early. Have had this beer in much better shape here previously, so waiting for a change of batch might be best, before ordering. Could not finish the glass!As far as the food goes, the Tex-Mex fries were a great accompaniment to the beers!If you go here, let us know what you think on our Instagram handle @beerdossier or share your thoughts/review with the Bangalore beer community on it's Facebook group, 'Bangalore Beer Club'.

We ordered Beer Battered Onion Rings, Flaming Chicken, Chicken Wings, Chicken Lollipop, Grilled Spicy Prawn and Chicken Sausages and all of them were very tasty. We then ordered the Arborita, Garden and Spicy BBQ Chicken Pizzas and they were very good but I was not a fan the Garden Pizza. We also ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and very happy we did so because it was excellent. Overall, it is a must visit if you are in Bangalore.

Needs improvement in that dish.Would recommend to go in week day as it is less crowded.Ambience - 5/5Taste - 4/5Service - 4/5                                                            ",39471243, 5.0,                                                                    25

Their Stout could be much better.‚ú¥FoodTheir menu is limited and hence every item is perfect.üîπBangalore NachosIt was a little salty but still good. Perfect crisps with lots of cheese. A must bar bite order.üîπFlaming ChickenAlmost 6-7 pieces in one plate. Chicken cooked good.üîπBacon & Caramelized Onions - recommendedA perfect 12 inch thin crust pizza with lots and lots of toppings. Lots of crisps bacon and the balance of taste was just commendable.üîπLemon Meringue Pie - recommendedI have just two obsession in desserts. Lemon pies and Gulab Jamuns.

The nachos had decent spread of black beans, beer cheese, sour cream, salsa and pepper but the nachos in particular felt oily which needs to be looked at. Flaming Chicken was recommended by our server which was spicy and yummy. We tried the Bacon pizza which was quite delicious because of the caramelized onions and mozarella cheese. But again, the bacon felt salty than normal which ruined the overall taste somehow. For desserts, we tried the Lemon Meringue pie which was quite delectable. Service was fast even though the footfall was increasing. They definitely need to pay bit more importance to the food otherwise there is nothing to improve.

However I did not like the concept of single bench like sitting which one has to share with many . You basically are sitting just next to another person whom you do not know but still can hear all his conversations (and vice versa). Food was good , nothing great but above average. I am talking about veg food here. There was a waiting of 15 mins which is acceptable on a sat night. We tried regular Ale and it was good. No complaints.

In spite of the fact that I have never liked stouts before, this one was really nice.We also ordered another brew called 'Smooth Criminal' which was a little flowery and sweet in taste. It was like a garden in a glass. It was also quite smooth and well brewed - would definitely recommend. For food, we ordered the Bangalore Nachos, Fancy Potato skins and the Greek Passion pizza. However, I would have to say that the food was extremely disappointing. The Bangalore nachos had kidney beans instead of black beans in them and they were very tasteless. The toppings could have been better.The potato skins were the best of the lot. They were stuffed with a good amount of cheese, but they could have been more crispy and better baked.The pizza was a catastrophe. It was inedible if it wasn't slathered in ketchup and condiments. The toppings were scarce and overall, just tasteless. We weren't able to finish even a slice each. We asked for mustard sauce and whatever we were served could be mango sauce for that matter, but it definitely wasn't mustard sauce.

Well socialize, eat and drink something non-alcoholic.I ended up here with some of the local colleagues during a business trip to Bangalore. They apparently thought that this is the best that Bengaluru can do so here we were.Though we were there by 7:15 PM on a Wednesday the place was still completely full! and we were asked to wait for 30 minutes atleast.Though the good thing is that you can still hit the bar and get your drinks, the half an hour wait turned into for than 75 minutes and our table was still not ready. So we the big group of about 14-15 people divided ourselves into smaller groups and squeezed ourself wherever we found some place.They have few communal tables, some sitting for couple and then some couches strewn along the place. We found ourselves on communal tables.As teetotaller you dont get much atleast on bar but once seated the F&B menu has enough for you, I just had a normal lemonade and we ordered some fries and pizzas.From the point of ordering the service was really fast none of our stuff took more than 10 minutes to come and everything was good for the prize we paid.With so many young people and loud music the noise level is always high, so you end up talking in a high pitch to be heard...contributing to the ever increasing noise.So if your idea for socializing is a loud place with lot of waiting and fairly expensive brew and food then this is the place for you.If you are looking for a quiet fine dining experience this is surely not a place for you.

Frankly this wasn't my first choice but as we got late to reach the place I booked, we chose this out of the blue, mostly due to my frends' recommendation.The place is beautiful and we were fortunate to have visited during odd hours on a weekend as it is said to be full otherwise.We chose to be seated at the rooftop area and were given a table at the non smoking zone. All good till here....but a few things I would like to mention, which I did not expect from such a highly rated place.- The place wasn't clean. Basically the table that was alloted to us had used tissues scattered across the floor. This is somehow acceptable if the crowd is huge, but at this time when they hardly had many customers to serve, this was not acceptable!- The service was slow and slightly below expectation. Though we had a server to ourselves, the professionalism was slightly lacking as per me. The way the order was taken or served later could have been better.Now, talking about the food:- Chicken roulade - I wanted to have continental and chose this out of the scant options available in the menu. Chicken in mushroom sauce basically which is one of my favs. The sauce could have been much better. Hardly any mushrooms. Chicken quantity was ok but should have been cooked slightly more. The mashed potatoes served along with was not that great and had small potato chunks in it- Veg pulao - this was decent in terms of the quantity and the veggies in it. However, the rice was very dry.- Prawn ghee roast - This was the star of our lunch. Perfect cooking with perfect masala. However, the quantity was very less- Pinacolada- This is my fav drink and I get really dissapointed if someone messes with it. The drink was sweeter than required and unsure why ice cubes were added to the top.Overall good experience in terms of ambience and a cool place to hangout, nothing great in terms of food though! I feel the place is not worth rating 4.9 in Zomato and is unwantedly hyped.",40506176, 3.0,                                                                    191

We were seated comfortably in one side, with a baby chair for my kiddo, who was busy sipping on his complementary juice and chewing the straw.So we called for our soups and salads to start with.A greek salad which was most ordinary, and a fig and feta cheese salad.¬†Now this was the first time i've ever got the dry fruit version of figs with cheese and just lettuce to go with it.. The moment the dish arrived, it was a shocker and it tasted no better than it looked.The manchow soup was ok, and we had a tandoori murgh which was slightly hard, but tasted alright.Among the main dishes, the veg chowmein was very average, and the vegetarian version of spaghetti carbonara was most disappointing. Very under seasoned and bland.¬†¬†The spaghetti bolognaise was probably the best dish we had all day, the amount of meat in the dish was huge, and outweighed the spaghetti in the end. Couldn't finish this bowl of food.In terms of flavour, presentation etc, the food was just above average.To add to it, most of the service staff seemed lost and confused, and it was not what i would call good service.Unless you stay very close by and want to explore another option, it's ok, but definitely not worth travelling specially.

Ambience was good. Now main part FOOD. We ordered crispy baby corn and BBQ chicken. Crispy baby corn was spicy and proper in taste. BBQ chicken on the other hand was sweet. But the thing I was disappointed with was the quantity they provided according to the cost. The quantity of food was much much lesser than expected. Next we took grilled paneer steak which was okay in taste, could have been much better. We also ordered Raoulde Chicken which was damn good in taste and it was served on a bed of cheesy mashed potato which was perfect in taste. Next we ordered honey glazed chicken which was sweet and again the quantity was much lesser than expected. We also ordered few drinks as virgin mojito, cosmopolitan and blue juice. Out of the three cosmopolitan tasted the best.

However, for me the main point of any review for a food joint must be the primary focus point which is food. In that department, this place is not even at par with some smaller food stalls. The chef need to understand putting heavy mayonnaise is not a great thing. We ordered chicken nachos which were full of mayonnaise and less chicken with a salsa salad on the side. The nachos were not at all crunchy and they were all very soggy. The chicken roulade is very sticky and bland, we need to ask for pepper and some seasoning to make it more enjoyable. The mash potatoes were very sticky and not like the proper one. Supposed to be saut√©ed vegetables were very limited and not at all great. We specifically requested for Garlic bread and the size of the bread and seasoning of that was disappointing. However, the service was good and the ambiance is good for having a long chat.

Had to wait for half an hour till we were cramped in a corner of the rooftop. The place was boggling with crowd. Hardly any space to move around once you get stuffed in your chair. I found the place really congested and cramped.The rooftop was decent and the terrace gardens added to the decor. Dim lights add ornace to the lounge.For starters we ordered Peri Peri Chicken ( the best one of the lot , do try it when you are here), Fish Fingers ( the fish was a bit stale ), Jalapeno Poppers and BBQ Chicken Wings( were pretty good too ). In mains we had Chicken steak ( I loved the tender juicy chicken ) , Chicken ghee roast and Penne Arabiata Pasta.My friends had beers and I had Cinderella ( cute bubbly presentation ). In desserts we had Dark Chocolate Mousse ( felt slightly less in quantity compared to the price ).Winners for me at TBC Sky Lounge : Peri Peri Chicken, Chicken Ghee Roast and Chicken Steak.Service is a bit slow but the place has got really good vibes and music was on top too.

The Bloody Mary, however, turned up slightly dilute and could have been better. The thing that stands out about this place is the courteousness of their staff.

On asking the security he was yelling at us for not knowing where to park. Pretty bad start. Please have a look into this as me and my partner were really offended for his rash demeanor. We proceeded to the top floor. It definitely resembles socials with all the decor with glass walls and plants. The ambience is a steal. The staff were very hospitable and welcoming. They arranged a cake for me which was a brownie and was extremely delicious. We started off with peri-peri chicken, Malai kebab, a honey chicken steak and white sauce pasta. Also we ordered cosmopolitan and a sex on the beach. The food was delicious. Peri-peri chicken was great. The honey glazed chicken steak was served with buttered rice and it was amazing. The pasta was good too. Cosmopolitan is a must try. Sex on the beach was average in terms of taste. I loved their garnishing! They also gave us free shots üòá Guys serving us were Anand and Suresh.

And the sceptic in me immediately wanted to check that out. After a quick, hassle free booking through Zomato, we landed up at TBC fairly early (7.30pm) on a weekday evening.The place is quite big, with a fair bit of outdoor seating available too. We plonked ourselves into a tiny corner and quickly got down to business. Their F&B menu is huge and it's quite a task to narrow down on something.We started off with a portion each of Hummus & Pita bread and Chicken Ghee Roast. The former was pretty decent dish, although the pita bread was found wanting. The CGR was more on the sweeter side and other places in Bangalore have better versions of the same to offer. We just ordered 1 beverage - Mint Jungle, which was meh!We ordered a 2nd helping of the Hummus, followed by a Fish & Chips and a Spaghetti Napolitano (veg). The Fish & Chips was an outright disaster and we had to send it back. Everything was horrible - from the chips to the batter to the way the fish was cooked. The Spaghetti was quite decent, with a generous sprinkling of pepperVFM - Around ‚Çπ1200.Verdict - It looks to have a handful of good things up its sleeve, but overall we were disappointed considering our expectations from the rating. But the place definitely does NOT deserve a 4.6 rating.

Drinks were pretty decent, specially I loved the doctor's hill which was a blast of flavour with brandy. For starters we ordered chilli beef and bacon wrapped chicken, both were decent, beef was tender and we'll cooked.I would recommend all to order the beef with broccoli for main course, it was delicious. It was perfect as a comfort food. Another popular favourite green Thai curry which was also full of flavour. Desserts are also good at this place, but a little pricey.

I just had a minced lamb steak though. It was prepared well & served with mashed potato instead of rice as I preferred so. Found the service especially remarkable as Mr. Uttam, who politely introduced himself later as the head chef, found me seated after my order & got me some finger chips to munch as I waited for my steak. I'm not really a fan of finger chips but found the gesture really kind. I also checked out the ambience in both the floors. Both the floors have lovely view of the HSR layout as well as sitting space inside. The steak was a little salty for my taste but I understand that is how it is usually had here. Looking forward to come here again.Above was written after my first visit. The second visit was with a friend. The tried & tested Minced Lamb Steak lived up to my expectation. I asked for a beef 'steak' that was not hot in taste & spicy. The waiter got 'Mexican Beef Stripes' which had a sauce that tasted like North Indian thick chutney that are served with snacks & it was pretty spicy & pungent. I wonder why the waiter suggested that even after a detailed discussion. Not expected for the price we pay is what I think. In addition to it the balcony sitting area on the first floor that I was fancying turned out to be rather mosquito-infested. This place loses 1 of the 4 stars I thought it deserved after my first visit.

Their reviews seemed to have improved since the few weeks after their opening, hence decided to give this place a try and it turned out to be not bad.Set on a rooftop at the beautiful and busy 27th Main in HSR, TBC Sky Lounge is rich with decor. The table settings and bar and the outdoor spaces are well arranged. The ambiance doesn't fare that well here as it was found to be a bit noisy. The lighting and indoor plant-life are set up well. We got a table right by the entrance where there was an outdoor area with bar-stools but since smoking was allowed there we did not opt for it. Our table was rickety and unstable which made the dining experience a bit annoying. Also the door to the outdoor smoking space was not well sealed and the smoke from the cancer-loving patrons were wafting inside making it uncomfortable at times.The Drinks menu is fairly large and had got a variety of cocktails that were rare in most places. Being a Coen Brothers fan I decided to try the White Russian. The Continental food menu for main course is tad too small. A friend had recommended me to try the Chef's special¬† Paneer Ghee Roast here so that was chosen as a a starter. As for the main course, we ordered the Broccoli BabyCorn Mushroom and a Roast Beef Steak.The dishes and drinks arrived pretty fast I must say. The White Russian did not disappoint and was an interesting drink (the lemon slice garnish was out of place and could have been avoided for this drink which is having milk cream in it). The Paneer Ghee Roast was splendid as mentioned. Its a bit spicy but the ghee flavor and perfectly soft Paneer that melts makes it a superb dish and must try item. The Shanghai style Broccoli Baby Corn Mushroom and Veg Fried rice combo was okay-ish but not outstanding. Some might enjoy the mild flavor of this dish. The Roast Beef was presented neatly with plenty of sauce. I wish I could have mentioned that I needed a medium-rare, as the beef served was a well-done one. the Sauce kind of compensates for it but I feel it would have been better with a less degree of cooking. The sauteed vegetables could have been cooked more, however the mashed potatoes were absolutely perfect.Our waiter Pranab was polite and fast attending to our table. We did have to give our feedback on the food to three different persons in between, which would have been little less awkward if it was dialed down to just 1 time. :)Overall, TBC Sky Lounge seems like a decent place with some good drink options. I believe they are taking good feedback from patrons and improving their food. Drinks are great, food is good and decor is wonderful. Ambiance could use some improvement. Giving it a 3/5 for now.Thanks for the readers.

So many restaurants are lined up in the locality that you seem to be spoilt for options. But as a firm believer of ultimate quality & experience (as accrued or rather say enhanced from the experiences of my dining at fine restaurants in Delhi), I have been very skeptical about trying a new restaurant - intense research goes on before I land up there. But this time it was 50% serendipity & 50% whimsicality. My friend came over to my place, he was pretty hungry and we needed a quick solution but a promising one. Well I handed the laptop to my friend for searching on zomato & the first suggestion was TBC Sky Lounge with a 4.6 rating. I said,‚ÄùTBC? Is that the green sign board that I am able to see from m balcony?‚Äù And that was affirmative. We looked at each other with a casual smile & told,‚ÄùAwesome! Why not!‚ÄùAct I: And We were there:And there we were, at TBC Sky Lounge. Let‚Äôs start then. When you are writing a review about TBC lounge, you have to obviously start with the mesmerizing ambience & the aesthetic decorations. Full of greeneries symmetrically placed at specific positions, this rooftop lounge is constructed out of wooden interiors, glass walls & glass roofs, in between there comes mild sunlight peeking at you & giving you a welcome full of life. The mild breeze from the fan above was blowing on our heads (it even touched our souls). In background, subtle delicate music was played on to soothe your mind. When we took the seat, Carlos Santana‚Äôs ‚ÄòMaria Maria‚Äô was on and easily this place stole our heart. Truly, this kind of set-up gave the place a touch of classy Prague-like summer cafe. It has been always my observation - interiors & ambience such classy & serene like this always elevates your mood just the time you enter (Even without touching the food) and with such an awesome setting, this place too was successful in providing the same. Words are flaccid, you actually have to be there to immerse yourself in the atmosphere.Act -II: Over the Hills & Far Away:Cheers to Happy Hours, While sipping on to some chilled BIRA Light beers in the ethereal atmosphere, we ordered two main course dishes - we had no idea that we were going to be blown by mesmerizing culinary delight. It was only a matter of time. When it comes to meat, I am particularly crazy about seafood & pork (once you start eating pork, you start wondering why the hell I was eating chicken the whole time; it‚Äôs like being awestruck by the beauty of the ocean where you thought serenity comes only in a peaceful boat ride on a lake), so naturally, Cheemen Molee & Pork Ribs Caught our eyes. And the wait began. Among bursts of laughter while reminiscing sweet college life, there was a growing anticipation about the salivating dishes to be served to soothe our stomach (& heart too) on the back of our minds.Act - III: Is this a real life or just a fantasy:After a slight irresistible wait (out of hunger at lunchtime), the real deal ultimately arrived - a bowl full of fragrant white long grain rice, steam flows slowly coming out of that and another bowl of shimmering yellow curry with loads of prawns immersed in it. This was the Cheemen Molee. Well, food is the definition of ‚ÄòTrue Love‚Äô to me, and it‚Äôs my habit to compare food with love emotions so that people can understand how ethereal it was. The first mouthful of the rice drenched with the gravy and both of us were somewhere near nirvana, one word spontaneously came out of my mouth, ‚ÄúDelicate!‚Äù Yeah, literally it was. It is like you are blown away by the serenity of¬† the next door girl (whom you see everyday but her beauty has become a commonplace to you) when she comes up in a traditional attire for some occasion and suddenly, your whole world is upside down - similar thing happened here - I have been eating prawns since the dawn of my life but this! This was something extraordinary. The yellow curry infused with fresh turmeric was rich in coconut (grinded & pasted) and a mild yet omnipresent citrus-y flavor added another dimension to the dish similar to casting a spell, the flavor was irresistible - this was the secret of the awesomeness. The texture of the prawns was a little firm - and that‚Äôs the way I like it. More importantly, the prawns absorbed all of the good essences of the thick curry, the own flavor of the prawns was not dominant but the combination itself with the gravy was serene, powerful and brought out the best in every item. It was like the union of Romeo & Juliet through death, both sacrificed their individuality but their union through sacrifice made their love tragic, made it universally superior, gave it an element of remembrance. While we were in awe of this dish, we were presented with the Pork Ribs - we could smell the pork fat from a few distance, we came to understand that this was the day to be blown away by mesmerizing food. Two large pieces of pork ribs dipped in sweet & tangy barbecue sauce (I believe) were presented with colorful veggies, an extra pot full of the same & some ghee-rice, I believe. The palate needed to be cleansed - hence, we went for a gentle drenching of beer. And simultaneously stepped on to the next stair towards divinity. The top layer of fat on the meat, aha! My heart was pounding with joy and shouting, ‚ÄúMy Precious! My Precious!‚Äù The meat was extremely tender, with each bite, every time the meat easily came of the bone and the mouthful, I can‚Äôt praise it enough - the rich flavor of the fat, the smokiness of the pork meat and the tanginess of the sauce - Oh my, my!!!! We literally devoured the ribs till there was hardly any meat left. We forgot about the ice totally by being overwhelmed by this culinary masterpiece. The balance between the veggies, the rice & the sauce was an interesting one - kept our palate wondering with a little twist at the last. The wholesome experience was a heightening one, a spell to remember.Act -IV: A ‚ÄòFood-Walk‚Äô to Remember:And lastly, I would like to praise our server Suresh immensely for his heart-warming, top notch hospitality & immaculate management of serving the orders at the ‚Äòjust right‚Äô moments. Kudos to you, Boy! Keep Up the good work.So, be it a cool summer party, a first-date to impress special one or in solitary you want to enjoy a heart-warming meal while enjoying the Bangalore weather on an exquisite rooftop - this place is just the perfect place to be. So, why wait? Do visit for some wholesome experiential awesomeness.

And the experience was beyond pathetic. The grill chicken was bland and we had to pay extra even for the mayonnaise which was very sweet. The chicken manchurian which was supposed to be Chinese item tasted like a proper Kerala Fish curry. We had ordered a jug of lime juice(3 glasses) seeing that the price was 125. When the bill came the price changed to Rs 185. While enquiring about this we were rudely told that the juice prices were not on the menu and could be seen from their juice shop downstairs. The menu downstairs on the wall read Rs 125. And while we raised this at the cash counter they said that they were yet to change the prices on the wall. The service was nothing to write home about. As they made us wait for 10 mins for the bill even after us tell them that we were in a hurry.All in all an experience that I would not want to revisit.                                                ,40268699, 1.0,                                                                    31

So we decided to have starter for all of us in one plate and asked for three more plates to have main course. To out surprise, Manager and his team told us they can give only two more plates, as we are supposed to get three plates and one has already been used for starter. It's real bad on part of such a restaurant with such a presence across Bengaluru).Team wasnt trying to understand and was continuously insisting on another two plates. After lot of argument, they finally gave additional plate. I never expected such a situation will come in a big restaurant like Empire.The story didn't end here, so paratha for buffet ended and many more people including us asked team for paratha. To which, team replied it's coming. Guess what after 20 min also it was coming.Horrible experience. Food was not upto the mark.

Both the parathas were requested to be cooked in butter and Queen size (the least in the lot; which is equal to 4 regular parathas). Parathas are served with Raita, Pickle and chutney. The chutney is spicy and way too delicious.My friends had Queen size Mutton keema paratha cooked with butter and they loved it to the core.

In the soups section, we ordered Vietnamese corn and asparagus soup and aromatic clear vegetable soup which were pretty good. Thai Green curry with rice is very good.

Hard Rock totally lives upto its name with its beautiful rock themed interiors and music. The place is just huge with awesome ambience.Coming to food, the happy hour menu is quite attractive. I have personally tried everything on that and definitely suggest Red hot chilli fries. I also tried the burger here, but I did not find it upto the mark, as it is just too expensive. Also there are better burgers available at a cheaper price at other chain of restaurants in Bangalore. I found the food especially very expensive. The drinks on the other hand was fine. Love the LIIT here.

It was probably an old bookstore, built all in stone, and looks fascinating. The interiors are equally captivating with walls lined with instruments, photos, and posters. I was able to absorb more of it because we visited the place at a very unconventional time - during lunch. There were hardly two more occupied tables. But apart from the decor, the food didn't impress me much, probably because it's not actually a food place. They have very limited veg options, so not much to choose from. We went for their Paneer Sashlik and a Hard Rock Veg Burger. The burger was delicious but the sashlik was extremely heavy and I couldn't finish it all.

We ordered starters and our drinks, courtesy Zomato Gold for which there was no hassle at all. However, we didn't think the mixture of Mojito was the best and certainly could have done better.

In one word, the place is expensive. The food is normal and u can get the same taste in lots of other place for much lesser amount. It is definitely not a place worth 4.6 rating  according to me. Maybe the rating is for the late evening or night time ambience. Anyways, on saying the rates, we decided to go during the happy hour. Had a pomegranate martini, berry blush martini, bhuna chicken spring roll, chicken wings and chilly cheese toast. The taste was good, but worth only the happy hour amount and not the whopping cost in the actual menu, which I thankfully didn‚Äôt have to pay!

A long drive away from where we live, but the experience was totally worth it. You'll see a few waiters open the door for you, which makes you feel rather grand üòÄ The ambience is quite nice.We ordered Veg Nachos for starter, which was a superb one at that. Please don't expect a teeny weeny quantity, it's HUGE! That could be a main course in itself. Fresh tomatoes, yummy cheese and crispy nachos, it was the perfect start.For the main course was the 'Original Legendary Burger'. It was a delicious burger but I wouldn't really call it 'legendary' üôÑ I would have liked the burger to be a bit more juicy, in the sense that it lacked proper dressing. Sure it had cheese but to have no mayo in a burger is quite the sin! However the patty was really awesome so overall the burger was still good. It was accompanied by some french fries and dips.The fact that Hard Rock Caf√© is Zomato Gold 2+2 on drinks makes it even more 'sweeter'. So I ordered the Mango Berry Cooler, which is non alcoholic (I'm 16). There are quite a bit of options for people or kids who cannot have alcohol. The drink was really refreshing but it was a tad too sugary for me. When we talked the manager, he even said he could replace the drink. We of course said it's okay but it was a nice gesture. He even let us try his own sampler creation just for us! Need I mention it was good as well? However the waiter we had ordered from was very unclear and seemed flustered. After that is was okay.Also the Mango Mojito was really good - it was a perfect mix. A well balanced drink.In the 'Infused with Love' menu, you'll see the three sliders given. I took the Riviera Slider and it was again good but two suggestions is to increase the quantity of chicken (which was delicious!) and well as a personal preference, I didn't like the addition of the green apple bits üò£Finally, the food came quite fast if you think about the quality of the food. Also the ambience was nice with a clean bathroom attached. With reputed places like these, the cost would be quite high - you'd have to pay probably about a good Rs.2,500 for two people - but it's totally worth it if you like to have some yummy food and just chill out! üç∫-with Reshma MudirakkalRatings:Food - 4.5/5Drinks - 4/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 3.5/5Overall experience - 4/5Follow me #thefoodiediaries for more such reviews!

Housed in the old Bible Society building in the middle of Bangalore the interiors scream classic HRC with memorabilia galore and small televisions playing music videos all around. There is a certain charm to the place that can't be matched anywhere else.The food is delicious and is proper Americana cuisine. Some things on the menu have been designed for the Indian palate but the burgers and nachos are exactly as it would be anywhere else in the world. The portions are humungous and can definitely fill any glutton. The nachos is a must try along with the chocolate cake for dessert.The drinks are flavourful and mixed at the bar which is always a nice touch to see some theatrics. They also have alot of events which are always packed and make for an amazing night out. Their service is also very good with very attentive waiters.I would rate this restaurant a 9/10                                        ,39014883, 4.0,                                                                    56

BUT, when we tasted the burgers there (bacon and beef burger)to our disappointment, it didn't taste as good. It wasn't juicy and tasted kinda blank. However, when we mentioned that, the chef made us try another burger which was good. Again, the wings we ordered we too tangy. The drinks were fine. Also, the place is kinda expensive, as we hardly ate anything but the bill was higher than expected. The reason I am only giving a three is because I expect much more from this place.

Most tables had families seated, with an average of 1-2 kids on these tables, the music was lower in volume than what you would find at Starbucks, and above all, again, this was at Saturday night dinner time.The only good part was the zomato gold, but even with that, we paid 2100 bucks for two. The hummus platter was good, with 3 different types of hummus and fresh veggies and toasted pita bread. The capriochka was decent as well, just too much ice. We tried one of the drinks on the Mexican menu, but that way too much ginger in it and had to be sent back.Overall when the rock part is missing and the experience wasnt any better than most cafes, I don't see why these guys charge a premium. Nothing special here to recommend at all.

The reception and the ordering was smooth. The Wild Berry Smoothie is definitely a must try. Tupelo Chicken Tenders had an excellent Barbeque and Honey Mustard Sauce . The chicken strips were crispy and fun. The Red Hot Chilli Fries, weren't hot as per my standard, but still they tasted great. The portion served was generous and definitely a good time killer. I wasn't impressed with their Shawarma Nachos which Was ordered from their Special Menu. Anyways it wasn't bad at all. Priced well, Hard Rock Cafe fires on all cylinders.

Perfect blend of flavors along with choice of 4 dips other than mint chutney and onion offered. Roasted chilli and Tossed peanut are my 2 top picks. The prices are pretty reasonable for the food served. Kudos to the team.

He ordered Fried Rice Chicken Combo for dinner. The combo we had was Egg fried served with Black pepper chicken. Priced at 187 the combo is good enough for 2 light eaters like us. Or else easily a filling meal for single heavy eater. Good thing is fried rice was made with Basmati Rice and Chicken used in Black pepper was fresh and soft with balanced taste of black pepper.                                                            ,39942609, 5.0,                                                                    40

Probably they are only one serving tandoori and Afghani Momo's in the locality. We ordered Mutton tandoori momos, Veg fried Momo's and Spaghetti Alfredo pasta. Our pick of the meal was Mutton tandoori Momo's. Perfect roast, juiciness and flavors. They had their own made choice of 4 dips for Momo's. Roasted chilli, Tossed peanut, Coreander Mayo and classic momo. All were good although classic momo could have been a bit more spicier. Pasta was creamy and flavors were good. A well priced outlet.

These beers are generally meant to be sessionable and refreshing on a hot summer afternoon.Aroma - Fresh and pleasing cucumber notes complemented by hints of coriander. There is a slightly sharp tartness and a very lemony feel on the nose. A light doughy and even lighter bready malt base carries these aromas very well.Appearance - Straw yellow coloured, moderately hazy with some tiny bubbles. Head retention is moderately low.Flavour - A light doughy and even slightly bready malt blanket carries same notes from the nose and presents it almost like a refreshing nimbu paani. Salty, with fresh coriander, with the balance of the beer leaning towards slightly acidic, but not overpowering. Finishes almost brine-y with a light saltiness on the lips and fresh notes of cucumber in the breath. A slightly more drier finish, would be even better.Mouthfeel - Medium Light bodied, with moderate carbonation. A slightly higher carbonation would bring up the freshness quotient some more.Overall, very impressed by the Gose. Makes me want to wake up on a hot summer morning and down these by the beach.

Big pitchers is a 5 story outlet, each for different types of customers. They have club (top floor), Brewery, Barbecue buffet, bar and Dine in place. I went to club. For couples, entry is free. For stag, it is 1500 on weekends. The club is huge. The bar is on complete different side and dance floor is on opposite side. Dj on Saturday night was amazing and he played all English, Hindi and Punjabi Songs. Some were gujrati even :P Good thing about banglore clubs and Bars is that they don‚Äôt play just English Songs.

This place deserves all the praises it is getting from the time it opened up in one of the popular cities for pub culture in India. It has beautiful different setting across 5 floors which will cater to different type of patrons. Some may want to enjoy old english pub feeling, some may like a dance floor where they can burst their weekly work stress, some may like to eat well with a buffet, some may like quiet evening with less music with their loved ones and some may like a place to take their business partners for delicious fresh food with few beers. This place has all of them in its housing. When we wanted to celebrate a raise in office we couldn't think of a better place than this as it has many options which new younger generation demands.¬†There was no reservation but the reception was co operating enough to accommodate us in a place which we liked. We pestered them with options across different floors but they helped us calmly. They had 6 types of beer varieties and we tried them all. All flavours are equally unique and good. If you are a beer lover like i am then you will find it a place to visit again and again. Ordered a murgh seekh kebab, galouti kebab, tawa chicken, tawa prawns, for starters and i had kahuna's pollo a la king for my main course. All were exquisite. Chef is amazing here. They have opened kitchen on 5th floor so you get to see the chef working and can request changes if you need in your food. I didn't want to do that because i was going here for first time. Quite frankly i don't want to change anything because the chef already makes your food as delicious and satisfied as possible. Service is quick so you won't have to just sit and wait for your order. Ambience is good. But they should really check the wall designs on the fifth floor because when compared to the rest of the restaurant that part looks very plain. Prices won't burn your pocket so you can well be assured to have a good time with your loved ones. I will be going here again since i've left a lot of their menu without trying. Will be hungry for more and hopefully they will add few more recipes for food lovers like me.

As you walk in you get to choose where you want to sit based on what kind of cuisine you are looking for.AppetizersTo start our meal we ordered the Club Kahuna Onion Rings, Smokey Cilantro Paneer, The Crunchy Shiitake, Button Bites. For the Onion Rings, the relationship between the crunchy and gooey textures was satisfying and melted both in our mouths and hearts. Accompanied by a strong flavour of Cilantro, the Paneer Tikka was certainly an all-time classic. The Crunchy Shiitake was very well cooked with a prominent Crunch on the outside and a chewy inside. We feel it was spiced to absolute perfection. The Button Bites was filled with just the right amount of Cheese and was something we absolutely loved.Main CourseFor the mains we ordered the Creamy Asparagus Crepe, Risotto Corn Broccoli and the Methi Chaman. The Crepe was easily the highlight of the mains with a great balance between the Asparagus and Corn filling. The Risotto unfortunately was bit of a disappointment as the rice could have been cooked better. The Methi Chaman was also a bit bland for our liking and we felt could have been seasoned better.DessertTo end our meal we ordered the Satin Coco Nutty Croustillant, Naked Chocolate Fantasy and the Tequila Tart Passion Bombe. The White Chocolate Marquis was very well made with just the right amount of sweetness. The Chocolate Cake could have been better as we felt the quality of Chocolate was not upto the mark. The Tequila Tart was unique and unlike anything we have had before. The Pineapple was certainly a great twist to the entire dish.Overall VerdictThis place honestly surprised looking at the sheer size of it. They have a different restaurant on each floor catering to different events and occasions. They have places ranging from a happening rooftop to a dancefloor and even a floor for a family setting. We loved the overall quality of food and drink and think this place would be perfect for any kind of meetup.Food: 4/5Price: 4/5Ambience: 4/5Service: 4.5/5",40171340, 4.0,                                                                    118

They have introduced some delicious items on their menu along with some innovative cocktails wonderful in-house craft beers. I loved some of their new dishes a lot. They are very well presented and some of them have a lot of innovation going into it. I appreciate their effort to use locally produced ingredients such as ragi/finger millet to their new Namma Ooru Pizza.They introduced some new cocktails, which my friends loved. I didn't try the cocktails since I was enjoying the beers. They are having six beer on tap. My top picks among the beer were the Czech Pilsener, the Weizen Bock (Kingslayer) and the American Pale Ale. I settled with the Pilsener after sampling all of them. I heard they are currently having a Brazilian version of Berliner Weise - a sour on tap.After sampling the beers, we tried out some of the appetisers. The Mutton Malai Chops was the best among all. It was well marinated in spiced fresh cream. The mutton was juicy and tender. Few other dishes that I loved a lot were the Club Kahuna Onion Rings, Crunchy Shititake, Button Bites, Fish Nam Phrik Pao and Sholay Murgh. The Onions Rings were crunchy on the outside and filled inside with cheese. The Crunchy Shiitake is another dish which is a must try for mushroom lovers.In the mains, the loved the creamy Risotto con Brocolli. The Creamy Asparagus Crepe was another wonderful dish, well presented and stuffed inside with corn and cheese. For some Indian fare, tried the Sarson da Saag Ghost and Methi Chaman. The Sarson da Saag Ghost had the best of both world - from Sarson da Saag and of Mutton. The Methi Chaman was a decent Paneer dish cooked in a spinach and methi gravy.The Namma Ooru pizza was a great initiative from Big Pitcher by using locally produced finger millets to prepare the base. The base is made out of 70% ragi/finger millet and 30% wheat. Though the taste was not that much impressive, I still liked it.To end the meal, we had Tiramis√π and Satin Coco Nutty Croustillant. The Tiramisu√π was average, I found the alcohol content to be a little more. Satin Coco Nutty Croustillant was an eggless dessert made out of milk chocolate, french flake and white chocolate marquise. This was pretty good. The presentation for both the desserts was fantastic.Now coming to the ambience, this place is huge and each floor has different themes - from a sports bar, buffet restaurant, dance floor to a rooftop.

Roof top is a good option to sit, drink and had talk with friends. Usually LIIT person but wanted to try something new as well. So we went for Gin Genious and Clovers club. Both of the drinks were pretty decent although nowhere near to LIIT. Clovers club is a good option for Litchi lovers. For food we ordered Farm house Pizza, Masala peanuts and Firecracker Chicken. Food was good although a bit overpriced considering GST and forceful service charge as well. They have written on their menu that we levy 7% service although everywhere else it's optional. Tipping of waiter is by your heart not by force. And to everywhere else I have been they waived off service charge when asked about it coz noone usually tips 700-800. But manager refused to waive off that and gave explanations.

The huge property is spread across 5 floors and each level is dedicated to a different theme.The ground floor has their microbrewey along with Club Kahuna which is more of a sports bar. The second floor is Splitwood which has a continental spread. The third floor has Sizzling Steaks and mostly has buffets. The fourth floor Studio 421 has the dancefloor. The terrace ( Star Lounge ) has the best decor but is only accessible evening onwards. We were at Splitwood which is totally cowboy themed. The decor is nicely done and will remind you of a Clint Eastwood movie set.We setlled down and started of with the beer samplers. Out of the six flavours the one which I loved the most would be the Hibiscus & Honey based Blood Ale. Visually appealing with beautiful aroma and taste, this one is up for keeps. For the milder versions, there's 'Adjust Maadi' & ' Sarava' with a fruity aftertaste. As an accomplishment we had a couple of veg and non vegetarian appetisers- Doodhia Kebab- Murgh Chandi Tikka- Fish Nam Phrik Pao- Crunchy Shitake Mushroom- Malai Mutton ChopsPoint to note is that the vegetarian stuffs were equally impressive as the non vegetarian ones. My heart goes out for the Malai Mutton Chops. It tasted phenomenal. The creamy texture had a nice feel in the palette. Next would be the Fish Nam Phrik. Thai fish preparations with oyester sauce in particular are classic combinations which can seldom go wrong. Exotic plating with great taste, the chilie was also quite well balanced. Both the kebabs were neatly done. Quality of paneer in particular was really good.For the main course the star item was the Ragi based pizza (Namma Ooru). The base is done with 70% ragi and 30% wheat giving a nice thin crust. It's definitely a healthy option. Obviously one would miss the extra cheese but I would say the idea is really great and as the name suggests good to have local ingredients incorporated in the recipe. Apart from the pizza I liked the seafood risotto. The vegetarians loved the Asaparagus crepe and the Methi Chaman.We barely had any space left for desserts but I took a bite of the naked chocolate fantasy & Coco Nutty Croustillant which seemed quite average.Overall,Big Pitcher is a decent place to hangout with your squad. Food is good especially the starters. Portions are an absolute value for money. The cocktails and the desserts need a bit of improvement.

This menu is perfectly curated with starters, finger food, main course and desserts from various cuisines. The malai Paneer tikka was melt in the mouth with a tangy flavour. The onion rings were fried and seasoned to perfection. The malai mutton chops were a huge hit too. For main course, I tried risotto which was cooked very well with subtle flavours. Nam oora pizza gives a nice twist to your usual pizza with a base made of ragi!The desserts were all gone in 5 seconds! Absolutely delicious!I loved all the beers brewed here but my favorite was Adjust Madi. Don't forget to try out their range of cocktails and mocktails.Spread across 5 floors, the ambience here is superb giving out a chill and relaxed vibe.. A perfect place to hang out with your friends post work or on a weekend. The staff are very courteous and responsive.Overall, one of the best places in Bangalore and don't miss trying out their new menu :) üíö                                                             ",39911639, 5.0,                                                                    48

Pretty crowded assuming the next day was a public holiday. I had not booked any reservation and post reaching the venue, I was offered to stand at the bar while they get me a table for 2. Waited there for sometime and saw some other girls arrived after me, the staff probably forgot and offered the table to those girls, would have been nice if someone noticed that I was before them. Anyway, when I enquired why nobody noticed this, there was this person who comes pretty close, without minding something called proxemics, pointing towards a table and tells me, let‚Äôs go. I was pretty upset with his tone and I immediately said, Iam not your friend and you need to be more polite. So, I definitely was upset with his behaviour and was about to leave. On that few other staff immediately took stock of the situation and offered us a table, apologised profusely and the service after that was great. Would like to mention- Saju, Sukumar and Rahul who were polite and knew how to handle an disappointed customer, which I feel is extremely critical in service industry. So, thank you!Food- We ordered their czech pilsner beer, we had lived in Prague for some time and thus wanted to taste the same. It was nice, fruity and refreshing. Even the wheat beer was good. For food the samosa filled with feta cheese was nice, crispy outside and gooey inside, The pepper chicken was also cooked to perfection, absolutely succulent and delicious!

You will find German, Brazilian beer also in dark or fruity. Though you will start feeling high with 300 ml only. Food is good there. We ordered hot wings, Gobi manchurian, paneer tikka and pizza which were equally good.

It served global cuisine and has one of the biggest ever dance floor.AMBIENCEThe floors are named as -Club kahuna- regular pub where maximum offers are provided.Splitwood- Irish themed bar with a foosball table.Sizzling street- with table grill concept, this is Buffet place favorite mainly among the corporates.Studio 4121- major attraction here is the massive dance floor, along with minimal seating and one bar counter.The star lounge- for VIP guests and with the most elegant bar counter and counter kitchen concept.FOOD and DRINKS¬∞Ek dam jhakas¬∞The pan flavored drink with a pan attached by the side was a total delight and one of the most unique fusion ever. However I would love if the betel leaf particles are filtered out and only gulkhand flavor resides in the drink.¬∞Whiplash¬∞Another interesting off bear cocktail with raspberry puree , this had whisky as base and ginger and cranberry as major flavors.¬∞Paneer dum ka roll¬∞This was a stuffed paneer roulade, fried to excellent crispiness, bit oily though. Tasted excellent and the cottage cheese stuffing was satisfactory.¬∞The crunchy shiitake¬∞I loved this version of shiitake mushroom, crispy fried and tossed well in chilli garlic and soy sauce.¬∞Doodhia kebab¬∞So the ajwain flavor was low and not very evident for me. Rest I loved the Malai quantity and spicing done to the paneer cubes.¬∞Scotch eggs¬∞Most unique looking and off beat concept, minced and spiced lamb covering boiled eggs and crumb fried, tasted excellent and must try.¬∞Green chicken ghee roast¬∞This one was my favorite takeaway from here, loved the balance of ghee flavor over saucy chicken pieces, and addition of cashews made it even more worthwhile. Must order.¬∞Namma ooru chicken pizza¬∞So this was on a regi base and the special base sauce made it taste really good. There were a number of toppings including tender chicken.¬∞Methi chaman¬∞Not exactly mashed to liquidity, but fibrous amalgam of methi and spinach , mixed with corn and paneer cubes, very subtle and very homely. Served with steamed rice or lacha parantha.¬∞Tiramisu¬∞Proper coffee flavor and low on sugar, way I like it .¬∞Panna cotta¬∞Three varieties of Panna cotta, filter coffee, blueberry and mango, one of the most magical presentation and delicious in every bite.SERVICE AND COSTINGCosting is towards medium expensive side, in line with other major pubs and bars across the city and service is top notch.

This place is big, like huge. 5 floors of just Big Pitcher with every floor with a different theme. Since we were a big group, we decided to take up the roof top seating. The music was loud but you could have a conversation on the table.The food was alright. The paneer tikka was the best. Decently cooked and well spiced. The sweet corn tamale cake was disgusting, stay away from it. The Chicken Tikka and the Platter was alright.The beer was what pulls the people and it was good too. A bit overpriced but Zomato Gold saved the day. For the mocktails, order the Good Omen which is the best of the lot and a close second comes Ticky Micky.Overall I would given this place a three was the disappointing overpriced food but the ambiance pulls it to 4 stars. Also, the staff are super courteous and one of those places where they encourage you to use Zomato Gold, so kudos.

While getting inside they gave us dhandiya sticks, but never ended up dancing with sticks.. No dhandiya night at all. We waited till 12.15 for dhandiya but no music... Drinks are okay. But I felt food is not good. It's below average. The cost is above 500 for each starter. We ordered BBQ chicken wings, which ended up being horrible coz of the sweet taste in it... I mentioned them to make it spicy but they didn't make a note of it... We even ordered mushroom chilly it was okay. Fresh brewed beer was average too... But the dance floor is awesome i must say... We just ended up dancing a lot that's it. Overall I would like to say is this place is good for dance floor. Food which we ordered was bad Choice maybe.

It's a 5 storey microbrewery with each floor catering to a different mood as is your need (including a dance floor, and a family styled restaurant as well!)They have a really great selection of microbrews and the cocktails are pretty potent (nothing spurious or disheartening there!)Having had the opportunity to guest visit a lot of microbreweries around the world, I would definitely put Big Pitcher on my top 5!But the best part about this place HAS TO BE its hospitality! Absolutely amazing!The floor manager Boi, goes above and beyond to check with all the guests (something which is really lacking in the restaurant business nowadays)Be sure to expect the warmest welcomes and have your needs taken care of to the fullest!Probably my only critique would be the food menu. Don't get me wrong, they do have an excellent sense of taste and food they bring out is generally always impeccable, however the menu is pretty limited. (might want to work on that a bit?)All in all a great VFM to be at! And given it's HUGE, you will generally always find atleast some place to sit and can expect to beat the queue!

I felt him to be rude as per service industry standards. Yeah I admit he was explaining the policy but there should be politeness in that which I didn‚Äôt found. Also, I don‚Äôt usually like such places where I have to look for someone before ordering. Specially the dance floor. There was almost no one at the first floor so we sat on the second floor as that was open seating and you can smoke on your table itself. Yeah. You heard me right (no separate smoking room which is a big inconvenience for a smoker like me). Then we ordered bailey‚Äôs, 100 pipers and their own beer called king slayer (I really liked the king slayer even though I hate him in GOT). Jokes aside, I don‚Äôt usually go for home brewed ones but this one was much better than what I have found in TOIT and alike. Prices were fine too. Kingslayer 350 ml was 300 or something. But there were issues related to my zomato gold their. Usually, I order everything and then show my zomato gold. I do know it is written that you are supposed to show it prior to the service. But most of the places I had been never had any problem with me showing it later too. Anyways, talking about dance floor, that was the most fun part of the night. Such a lovely crowd which I was not expecting while drinking at second floor. Specially if you are into Bollywood music, you are gonna love the DJ then. For a North Indian, I really loved the music for a change as I heard punjabi and Marwadi too. üòÇüòÖ break from usual EDM.

I have been here earlier and have always liked their food. While writing the review I noticed that the menu on Zomato has additional pages which we were not given. We were given only one menu for food and one for drinks. We were seated at the 2nd floor so I‚Äôm not sure if they have additional menu for some other floor. The ambience is ok there and being a Friday night I expected some good music but seems like they play it only on their dance floor which is downstairs. They had a foosball table on the second floor and people and kids were enjoying it alike. Even though we had a corner table we had someone waiting on us promptly and the service was also pretty quick. Also they randomly had some dhol players come and play on each floor for sometime for people to dance to keep things entertaining.For starters, we had ordered panfried veg noodles. The noodles had a little gravy with saut√©ed vegetables. If you like asian then you will like it. Light, simple yet appetising. Spring rolls were good. Jugal bandhi gobhi was just ok, the flavor didn‚Äôt quite soak in the gobhi which felt undercooked. Satay chicken was good.Their Naanzaa(veg pizza) was just amazing! Every bite of it felt like we were eating some north indian makhan wali sabzi along with kulcha, must try!! Their non veg platter was good.For main course we ordered khush mehek paneer (good), sofiyana aloo(ok) and butter naan. Naan felt chewy and it came cold. For nonveg we ordered a chicken and lamb dish. Both were good.Overall their food and service is good but I felt like the food that came in wasn‚Äôt as hot as expected.For drinks we ordered sangria which was good, Good omen (good), Electric lemon(tasted like cough syrup), Tricky mickey(ok). The one thing I liked the most was that they cut fresh fruits and made the drinks and also decorated the drink glasses with freshly cut and juicy fruits.One of the most impressive things I saw here was that they offer a valet drop off service. I didn‚Äôt try it but was glad to have that option. More places should come up with this service.",39373005, 4.0,                                                                    79

In mocktail we had Pina colada(too sweet), fruit punch (tasted like banana milkshake) and chocolate shake. For lunch the biryani was damn good as we didnt expect it to be so awesome as most of the buffet places don't have that good of main course items.The desserts were little disappointing as just 1-2 items were worth trying and the ice cream had almost melted. Another disappointing fact was that the service was very slow and that's the reason why I have given 4stars. All together the experience was great.Everyone should give it a try once for the buffet at least.Giving four stars because it was too hot to sit.

Situated opposite to Intel at Old airport road, this is a huge 3-4 storeyed building entirely owned by them. Good things are each floor is designated to each category namely barbeque, fine dining, pub/dance floor, rooftop dining and hookkkah.Music was loud enough for you to loose your senses at the same time the pub had solid sound proofing so that the other floors must not get affected by it. Huge dance floor with an kickass DJ burning through the night.Food was good but a bit on the expensive side but I wouldnt deduct a str because they have this packages which let you enjoy a 3-5 course meal in candle light at a reasonable rate.Only downside would be the distance as its way too far for someone to reach from electronic city.

Expensive starters. That's them in a nutshell.When I first visited this place about two years ago, BP's craft beer was nothing worth writing home about, and I never thought I'd go back return. However, we decided to try it once again on the recommendation of a friend and were pleasantly surprised.Big Pitcher has revamped their craft beer offerings, and I'd definitely give them a thumbs up this time around. They even had a one-for-one offer, which helped make up our minds about trying it out!What was not so great however, was the starter we had. We tried the sriracha butter chicken, and while they scored well on taste, the quantity we got was quite low considering its price tag of Rs. 479. They packed in more vegetables to make it appear like a large serving. It's almost as if the starters are meant to balance out the slightly lower price of the beer.All in all, I don't really see myself doing by anytime soon, because toit still gives me better bang for my buck.

The place is well lit and like one can presume from the previous statement, the area is huge and thus has ample space for people to sit, dance and have a good time. We ordered Lit (long island iced tea and four play from the drinks menu. I should tell you I'm not someone who gets impressed by cocktails easily because more often than not they are diluted.

Even tried the most darkest beer Kingslayer which was pretty good as well and super strong :)Ordered French Fries, which was good but the price way too expensive, 389 rupees without taxes, for hand full of French fries. This could be corrected at least in terms of quantity.Other starters like Olivation Chicken and Stuffed Mushrooms were quite good.Also, best part is we could save about 2-3k on drinks by using Zomato Gold.

I always plan for this place which never happend, but this time one of friend reserved the table and called me for a surprise.Well this place is having 5 floors and all floor are different.Like the ground floor is a multicuisine, 2nd floor is confidential and some other stuff (semi closed area), 4th floor is having dance floor, Roof top is an open space(as described by the attendant). As a like open space we went to the 5th floor and it was special for seafoods, tandoor and tawa receipe. But if you want you can order any finger food by checking with the attendant and they will serve you.Place is well maintained. Food and Beverages quality is very nice, all food tastes delicious. But the price of foods are little high.And the customer service is of 5 star üåü.I would recommend people to try this place for sure.
